   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Microbiological and Ecological Responses to Global Environmental Changes</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">MERGE is an umbrella program that aims to understand the responses of terrestrial, limnetic and supraglacial polar ecosystems to climate change. 

Theme 1: Diversity and biogeography answers "What taxa are present, how are the communities organized and how are they distributed, and where are they?" Conventional and modern techniques, i.e., culture-dependent to meta-genomic approaches will be used to analyze community structure and biogeography of Polar terrestrial, limnetic and supraglacial ecosystems. Addressing this theme will produce reference collections of Polar organisms and genetic material such as bulk environmental DNA. Selected groups of organisms will be studied to associate species diversification with geographical separation, and to screen for unique physiological and biochemical functions that occur in response to the extreme conditions of polar habitats.

Theme 2: Food webs and ecosystem evolution will answer the question "How do high-latitude biota interact and function?" Food webs in polar habitats have reduced complexity relative to lower latitudes and are thus likely to be sensitive to changes in species composition. Food web analyses have also highlighted the vulnerability of polar terrestrial ecosystems to climate changes. Palaeo-environmental analysis of diatoms, chemical biomarkers and other records in lake sediment cores have the potential to reveal how climate and environmental changes have driven species successions and ecosystem evolution. Process studies will include analysis of microbial production and interactions, in addition to carbon and nitrogen cycling including microbial controls on CO2 and CH4 dynamics.

Theme 3: Linkages between biological, chemical and physical processes in the supraglacial biome lucidates "How do physical, chemical and biological processes interact in icy ecosystems?" Supraglacial habitats include water-saturated snow, supraglacial channels, cryoconite holes and veins in ice. Biogeochemical processes in these environments transform atmospheric inputs to the glacier, in a similar way that watershed surfaces modify atmospheric inputs in temperate environments. This work will document the range and nature of aquatic ecosystems on the surfaces of glaciers in the Arctic and Antarctic. In doing so controls on biological productivity (physical, chemical, biological); key biogeochemical transformations; and linkages between biological activity and atmospheric fluxes of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to glacial surfaces will be characterised. Some complementary studies will also be undertaken on ice shelf cryo-ecosystems that occur in both polar regions and that have some microbiological similarities to cryoconite systems.

The major purpose of the MERGE umbrella is to provide and expand the chances for sharing/exchanging/offering data, samples, logistics, expedition opportunities, field facilities, laboratories, analytical instruments, etc between the research themes.

MERGE contributes to the EBA SCAR programme.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Coordinated Eastern Arctic Experiment (CEAREX) was conducted to
study the processes regulating eastern Arctic Ocean exchange of
momentum, heat, and biomass. The primary CEAREX objectives were to
understand the structure and function of mesoscale and submesoscale
process in the transport of heat northward, and to understand the ice
behavior and associated acoustic ambient noise and coherence (CEAREX,
1990).
CEAREX was a multi-national, multi-platform field program carried out
in the Greenland and Norwegian Seas and north to Svalbard, from
September 1988 through May 1989. Participating nations included
Canada, Denmark, France, Norway, and the United States. The field
program consisted of four phases: Polarbjorn Drift Phase, Whaler's
Bay/SIZEX Phase, Oceanography Camp Phase, and Acoustic Camp Phase.
CEAREX collected data on meteorological conditions, bathymetry,
hydrography, acoustic and ambient noise, sea ice dynamics
(acceleration, deformation, stress), positions from GPS satellite
measurements, and biophysical data. Data were collected using ship
platforms, ARGOS buoys, helicopter and aircraft, meteorology stations
on the drifting ice, rawinsonde, CTD casts, and satellites.
CEAREX was sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An international cooperative effort to increase tropical taxonomic expertise, conduct a taxonomically diversified global census of coral reef ecosystems, and improve access to and unify coral reef ecosystem information scattered throughout the globe.

Coral reefs are considered to be the most biologically diverse of all marine ecosystems.  While individual reef systems likely host tens of thousands of species, most of this diversity remains undocumented.  Significant declines in key indicators of reef ecosystem health suggest a degradation of coral reefs globally in response to the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors. The vulnerability of coral reef ecosystems is anticipated to increase significantly in response to climate change induced coral bleaching and disease, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and changing storm tracks. There is a clear danger that much reef biodiversity could be lost before it is even documented, and researchers will be left with a limited and poor understanding of undisturbed reef communities on which to base future management decisions.  Under these rapidly changing conditions, a key goal for reef resource managers and policy makers over the next several decades will be the development of tools to increase the resilience of global communities through effective conservation of coral reef biodiversity.  In order to develop reasonable approaches to improve the resilience of coral reef biodiversity, and to effectively use the ecosystem approach to management, it is first necessary to understand existing biodiversity and changes over time.

The GIS database, mainly focusing upon land cover/land use and
population, was developed as a joint effort between the Beijer
Institute, Stockholm; the Department of Systems Ecology,
Stockholm University; and UNEP/GRID-Arendal.  The database was
used for analytical purposes during the BDBP. Following this,
the GIS database was further refined and prepared for public
dissemination. Concurrently, a number of maps in conventional
graphical formats were prepared and included. The GIS and Maps
database was first released in August 1995. Later, a number of
statistical tables, also derived from the GIS database, were
included. The available data sets include administrative units,
arable lands, pasture lands, coastlines, land cover, population
density, sub-watershed drainage basins, and wetland
distribution.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Harmful Algal Bloom</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
Concerns about harmful algal blooms (HAB) have increased over the last
decade largely because of the perceived increase in the number and
duration of events. The toxins produced by these species cause finfish
and shellfish poisoning, and mortality of marine animals, including
mammals and birds.

Advance warning of HABs increases the options for managing these
events. The HAB Project develops and supports systems that provide
information on the location and extent of red tide blooms in the Gulf
of Mexico. The Experimental HAB bulletin alerts subscribers to
developing blooms and changes in the location and extent of existing
blooms. The HAB Mapping System (HABMapS) provides the position of an
identified bloom and data from environmental conditions that may
affect the extent or position. Both tools rely on remote sensing
technology to provide the large spatial scale and high frequency of
observations required to assess bloom location and movements. These
tools can be used together to provide a regional perspective on HAB
events.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Observations of Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC), Aurora, from the International Space Station (ISS).</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">We propose to coordinate the synchronized observations of Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC) and aurora between the International Space Station (ISS), ground sites, and satellites. We also propose to coordinate observations from other International Polar Year (IPY) activities that might benefit from ISS observations.
The orbit of the ISS takes it to north and south latitudes of 51.6 degrees at altitudes of 400 km. This provides a human operated platform from which to observe artic and Antarctic phenomena on a length scale of half a continent. This compliments ground site observations and satellite data that can be synchronized in both space and time to record seasonal variations. Observations from the ISS offers an above the cloud vantage including wide angle oblique views, sun-glint textures, day-night terminator lighting, and perhaps most important, human guided observations that can fall outside the purview of pre-programmed field of view instrumentation. The ISS offers a unique platform for Antarctic atmospheric observations since it gives repeated coverage circumscribing the continent every few days where cloud cover the general lack of observation sites limits routine ground observations over long periods of time.
We propose to use the current observational equipment on ISS including a suite of digital still cameras, standard video cameras, and a medium resolution, fiber optic coupled visible region spectrograph. We are planning the fabrication for use on ISS of an IMAX-sized format, CCD camera optimised for low light level video if funding permits. With the NASA presidential directive for human exploration beyond Earth orbit, NASA is considering astronaut training in polar regions as analogues for human planetary missions. We propose to coordinate these polar analogue activities with ISS observations.
Participation in this proposal will be open to all international partners to ISS as well as any other project that wishes to coordinate observations with ISS. All ISS collected data will be archived and publicly distributed using current NASA infrastructure. This activity offers great potential for educational outreach by linking human exploration from Earth polar extremes to Earth orbital extremes to Lunar and Martian extremes. The outreach will use current NASA educational infrastructure.
Background
This proposal resulted from prior collaborations when the Lead Contact was a crewmember and Science Officer on Expedition 6 to ISS. During this expedition, synchronized aurora observations were made between ISS and ground observers in Finland. Observations of Antarctic PMC were routinely made and subsequently correlated with SNOE satellite data with collaborators from University of Colorado and University of Alaska. These efforts proved the utility of making synchronized observations between ISS, ground, and satellite and resulted in this proposal. This proposal has been submitted with the approval of Dr. Jim Garvin, NASA Chief Scientist, in the NASA Washington DC office.

Polar environments are changing rapidly. Resulting impacts on terrestrial/freshwater ecosystems affect a) higher trophic levels and resources for Arctic residents, b) biodiversity in both polar regions and beyond due to the migration of many species, and c) land-atmosphere processes through changes in surface reflectivity and exchange of trace gases. 
Polar lands are vast and diverse and the knowledge of geographical variation in recent ecosystem change is limited. Attribution of change is difficult because the primary drivers vary from site to site and between the poles: at some sites multiple drivers of change (e.g. climate, UV-B, contaminants, habitat fragmentation) operate concurrently. 
Between 1964 and 1974, a network of IBP* Tundra Biome sites was established in both polar areas. Intensive investigations of primary production, production processes, decomposition, plant community structure and soil fauna were carried out together with studies of freshwater ecosystems. These sites and many of the original researchers represent a unique asset for detecting multidecadal environmental change. IPY provides timely opportunities for collating data on past changes, passing knowledge to new generations of researchers and documenting environmental characteristics of sites to facilitate detection and attribution of future changes at IBP sites and others, and on IBP topics in an interdisciplinary context. 

Goals
1. To assess multidecadal past changes in the structure and function of Polar terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and environments in relation to diverse divers of change 
2. To assess the current status of Polar ecosystems and their biodiversity
3. To permanently record precise locations of old sites in order to perpetuate platforms for a) the assessment of future changes in Polar ecosystems and their environments and b) sampling for Polar research and assessment programmes.

Approach
IBP sites in both polar regions will be re-visited, documented, and pinpointed with GPS. IBP Tundra Biome alpine and temperate upland sites will be included: comparison among such diverse, cold sites gave increased information on the environmental controls of ecosystem processes. The cold, temperate sites are now even more relevant as they represent analogues of future, warmer, polar sites. BTF will also include appropriate non-IBP polar and sub-polar sites. Investigations of primary production, production processes, decomposition, plant community structure and soil fauna will be repeated using original techniques. Additional measurements (biological and non-biological) will be made following meetings of the BTF group and representatives of linked projects (e.g. ITEX*, IPA*, TARANTELLA*) to maximise the efficiency of time in the field in often remote localities and to ensure cross-disciplinary connections. 
BTF will include, or link to, remote sensing projects that will provide a larger geographical context (GOA*) and provide baseline information on vegetation structure from radar and laser remote sensing. The sites will provide validation for remote sensing and modelling communities. The network will also include other aspects of retrospective analysis of ecosystems (e.g. photographic records from the late 1960&amp;#039;s) and populations (e.g. retrospective growth analyses) and provide sampling possibilities for various environmental assessments. The project will be implemented by younger researchers interacting with older generations. Data and metadata will be registered with the IPY Project COMAAR.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Understanding environmental change and its biological, physical, social, subsistence and cultural effects in national parks and protected areas of Alaska, Chukotka, and the Yukon</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The U.S. National Park Service (NPS) proposes a series of integrated research, monitoring, education and outreach projects designed to better understand and communicate change in Arctic environments in Alaska (United States) and adjacent areas of Chukotka (Russia) and the Yukon Territory (Canada). Proposed projects within this effort include the following:

Implement the “Vital Sign” Monitoring Program for Arctic (ARCN) and Central Alaska (CAKN) Networks. These new programs, based on conceptual models and long term monitoring objectives now in development, will implement monitoring of a broad suite of biological, chemical and physical indicators on 40.6 million acres of NPS lands and waters in and around eight national park units in Alaska. Implement baseline archaeological inventories and ethnographic research: During 2007-2008 new archaeological inventories will be conducted at selected locations in Cape Krusenstern, Denali, and Yukon-Charley Rivers to locate and systematically document prehistoric human occupation sites in arctic and subarctic coastal, inland, and riverine environments. Also, ethnographic research at Yukon-Charley will synthesize oral, written and archival data to produce a comprehensive ethnographic assessment.
Report results of the Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Program (WACAP). During 2007-2008 this ongoing multi-regional inter-agency US program will report on airborne contaminants in arctic, subarctic, high-altitude and high latitude areas. A series of journal articles and presentations will be submitted for publication during the IPY. Results will include contaminants assessments, spring snow pack data, and atmospheric back trajectories for multiple airborne contaminants potentially affecting polar areas. A separate study will report on biological effects of airborne heavy metal deposition (mineral dust) in Cape Krusenstern.
Convene two conferences on arctic parks and protected areas. Scientific conferences and workshops focused on science and conservation of Arctic ecosystems and cultures will be co-sponsored by NPS during the IPY. The 2007 (bilingual) conference in Chukotka will be organized with Russian cooperators through the Beringian International Heritage Program (Beringia). The 2008 symposium in Alaska will be organized with the USGS, other US cooperating agencies, and possibly Beringia program cooperators. Both symposia will be multi-disciplinary (biological, physical, cultural, and social sciences).
Focused journal issue on climate change in Alaska’s national parks. A focused issue of the Alaska Park Science journal will be published during 2007 in both printed and web-based formats. Internet-based supporting materials, targeted to meet the curriculum requirements of middle and high-school science teachers and students, will also be developed. Issues in 2008-2009 will highlight findings from research underway during IPY.
Digitized photo archives of arctic national parks. NPS collections of Alaska photos will be screened and a representative collection of historic photographs documenting natural and cultural resources and human activities in Alaska’s NPS areas (targeting 50-100 photographs of each area) will be digitally reproduced for use in IPY symposia and publications. This collection will also be augmented by recent photos, possibly including repeat visits to photograph and document change at the sites of historic photographs. Augment photo collection by working in cooperation with local Native residents and Native entities of the 36 neighboring communities to Arctic parks to acquire copies of historical photos documenting historical landform conditions. Obtain use permission, digitize and make available to Arctic researchers for use as dated baseline conditions.
Focused competitive funding programs. Support for a series of new focused projects will be provided through identification and consideration of IPY-related criteria in the proposal request and evaluation processes of appropriate National Park Service competitive grant programs. Eligible activities will include research, natural and cultural resource inventories and monitoring, recording of local and traditional knowledge, trend analysis, education and public outreach in Alaska and adjacent areas of Chukotka and the Yukon Territory. For IPY 2007-2008 we will specifically invite proposals to study and inform the public about: arctic/subarctic climate change, global and local contaminants, exotic species in the arctic and subarctic, increasing human use of parks and protected areas, and resource development within and surrounding these areas.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Kwajalein Experiment (KWAJEX), held 23 July - 15 September 1999, was a field observation campaign centered on Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands and sponsored by NASA in cooperation with the U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll/Kwajalein Missile Range and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. The joint U.S.-Japan Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite was launched in November 1997 and uses a Ku-band radar and a multi-channel passive microwave radiometer to map precipitation in the tropics. A number of physical assumptions are made within the TRMM satellite algorithms in order to obtain rain rates from the the satellite-measured radiances. The goals of KWAJEX were focused on making observations to reduce uncertainty in these physical assumptions by gathering a coordinated data set of airborne, shipborne, and ground-based measurements within tropical open ocean precipitating clouds. This site integrates information on the specific measurements made during the KWAJEX field campaign and on the ongoing data processing and analysis.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: HIAA
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=140
We propose to establish a program to investigate the interactions among aerosols, clouds and precipitation in the Arctic, and the impact of variations and changes in aerosol characteristics on precipitation, snow cover, river flow, permafrost and surface temperature. Observations of increasing precipitation, rising river flow, declining snow cover, and thawing permafrost indicate substantial changes to the Arctic hydrological cycle. Variations and changes in the Arctic hydrological cycle are likely to arise from a complex interplay between natural internal modes of climate variability and anthropogenic activity. Variations in atmospheric aerosol characteristics have the potential to modulate the Arctic hydrological cycle both directly through its impact on precipitation and also indirectly through its impact on temperature. Atmospheric aerosols influence the nucleation of cloud particles, which influences directly the cloud cover and precipitation processes, and hence forces variations in the river runoff, snow cover, permafrost, glacial accumulation, and surface temperature. Biomass burning in the northern forests, pollution aerosol, biogenic aerosol, and desert dust have been proposed as significant sources of Arctic aerosol. 

During the IPY, we will examine seasonal and regional variations, focusing on the North American Arctic and the Eurasian Arctic land regions. We will establish a multi-disciplinary observing network of atmospheric and surface hydrological observations, integrating existing observations (surface and satellite) and supplementing them with UAV measurements and enhanced surface observations during a special field campaign. Diagnostic and modeling studies will be conducted to document and understand the role of variations of aerosols in influencing variations of the Arctic hydrological cycle, towards predicting these variations and using these predictions in regional decision making. We will attempt to clarify the interactions between warming and variations in aerosol characteristics on the changing Arctic hydrological cycle.

The field measurements undertaken during the IPY will be placed in a broader context through the synthesis of recent field observations, regional model development efforts, historical data sets, and global model simulations to assess the current status and research required for substantially improved predictions of Arctic precipitation and an assessment of the role of aerosols in forcing variations in the arctic hydrological cycle. To address this goal, we will conduct the following:
i) Statistical analysis of local precipitation variability in the selected basins for the past 50 years, and interpretation of this variability in the context of internal modes of climate variability, local topography, local measurements of aerosol optical depth, and proximity to local sources of air pollution. 
ii) Application of a mesoscale model with sophisticated cloud microphysical processes to investigate the sensitivity of precipitation amount and phase to aerosol physical and chemical characteristics, to simulate the impact of biomass burning, pollution aerosol, volcanic aerosol, and desert dust.
iv) Application of winter/spring mesoscale simulations using varying aerosol characteristics to force the Catchment-based land Surface Model (CLSM) in the selected basins to assess the impact of aerosol variations on runoff, timing of snow melt, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and permafrost.
v) Assessment of the potential for seasonal and subseasonal predictability of snow melt and permafrost thaw and the disappearance of the snow roads.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Bromine Latitudinal Air/Sea Transect</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Bromine Latitudinal Air/Sea Transect (BLAST) expeditions by
NOAA/CMDL consisted of 3 cruises. BLAST I in 1994 in the Eastern
Pacific Ocean, BLAST II, also in 1994 in the Atlantic Ocean, and BLAST
III in 1996 in the Southern Oceans near Antarctica.
The BLAST I 1994 expedition was intended to test the reliabilty of a
gas chromatograph / mass spectrometer (GC/MS) combination instrument
at sea and then measure methyl bromide (CH3Br) in the marine air and
the surface waters of the East Pacific Ocean to determine whether the
ocean is a source or a sink for this compound. Along with methyl
bromide, about 20 other compounds in both air and surface waters was
measured.  The BLAST I expedition started in Seattle, WA, crossed
several regions of the East Pacific and reached the inland passage of
Chile at 41 degrees S, and finally Punta Arenas, Chile, at 54 degrees
S about 4.5 weeks after its beginning. The NOAA Ship Discoverer (R
102) was used in the BLAST I expedition.
The BLAST II 1994 cruise was a continuation of the BLAST I 94 mission
in order to verify findings from the first cruise, but in the Atlantic
Ocean rather than the Pacific. In addition to all compounds that were
measured during BLAST 94, other halogenated methanes were also
measured.  The cruise covered an equally wide latitudinal range as
BLAST 94, similar oceanic regimes such as coastal and coastally
influenced waters, upwelling regions and open ocean gyres, but
slightly different seasons, fall in the northern hemisphere and spring
in the southern hemisphere.  The entire cruise was almost 5 weeks long
and was conducted between 18 October, 1994 and 21 November, 1994. The
data for methyl bromide basically confirmed what was seen during BLAST
I 94 and contributed valuable information to NOAA/CMDL's database for
methyl halides. The ship FS Polarstern, used for the BLAST II
expedition, operates out of Bremerhaven, Germany, and is run by the
Alfred Wegener Polarforschung mainly as a research vessel and supply
ship for the German Antarctica station Georg von Neumayer.
The BLAST III cruise was conducted between February 22nd and April
7th, 1996 from McMurdo, Antarctica, along the coast and through the
ice of Antarctica to Punta Arenas, Chile. This cruise was a
continuation of previous BLAST cruises. The main focus on these
expeditions has been the measurement of methyl bromide and a suite of
other methyl halides, very similar to the setup during BLAST II.  The
ship Nathanial Palmer, used for the BLAST III expedition, is operated
by Antarctic Support Associates which headquarters located in
Englewood, Colorado.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Ocean-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange Study (OACES) of NOAA&amp;#039;s Climate and Global Change (C&amp;GC) Program has two major scientific objectives. The first is to carry out high- quality measurements of carbon dioxide (CO 2) system parameters that can be used to document the transient invasion of fossil fuel derived CO 2 into the ocean&amp;#039;s interior. The second is to utilize these observations in ocean and atmosphere general circulation models to enable more accurate predictions of future climate change on decadal to centennial timescales. In support of these objectives, the OACES program has been making carbon system measurements on deep ocean survey cruises as well as time-series measurements of atmospheric l2CO 2 and 13CO 2 at NOAA&amp;#039;s global cooperative flask sampling network sites. 

Program Interfaces: 
The OACES program addresses research relevant to the goals of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S. JGOFS), a core activity of the International Geosphere- Biosphere Programme (IGBP). OACES research is also relevant to activities of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) program, also of IGBP. The IGAC program includes global measurements and modeling of atmospheric CO 2 and its isotopic composition. With respect to NASA, the oceanic measurements made along meridional ocean sections and process study cruises supported by OACES will provide valuable information to the NASA SeaWIFS Ocean Color Satellite mission, namely in situ ocean data that can be used to validate information derived from the satellite (i.e., &amp;ground-truthing&amp;). Another partner in the quest to understand the global carbon cycle is the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). In addition to supporting CO 2 measurements on World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises, DOE is providing certified seawater reference materials to investigators to ensure the analytical quality control of seawater total CO 2 measurements.

The IGCP (International Geological Correlation Program)aimed at
documenting lithosphere-asthenosphere dynamic effects in two major
collision zones and assessing their role in determining seismic and
volcanic hazards. The two densely populated collision zones embrace
the PANCARDI (Pannonia, Carpathians, Dinarides) and the SEAWPAC
(Southeast Asia-Western Pacific) regions. This project will address
mantle flow and lithosphere kinematics and document mantle
characteristics using geophysical, petrological, geochemical and
geochronological techniques.  To resolve macro- and micro-plate
collision-related lithosphere kinematics, the geophysical
investigations include seismic tomographic and shear-wave splitting
experiments, and palaeomagnetic, gravity and geodetic studies. The
data acquired will then be integrated to produce risk inventory
GIS/maps relating mantle dynamics to natural geological hazards in
densely populated target areas. The societal aspects of the project
include assessments of geothermal energy and volcanic and seismic
hazards assessment. Benefits also include enhanced research and
educational ties and exchange opportunities between member countries.
Cooperation with several IGCP, IASPEI, IAVCEI, and ILP projects is
planned. The duration of the project is five years.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Integrated Global Ocean Services System</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
      IGOSS is an important data acquisition and management systems
      that will form, with other existing systems, the "Marine
      Meteorological and Oceanographic Operational Services" Module of
      the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).

      The Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS) is the
      international SYSTEM for the collection and exchange of ocean
      data (such as temperature and salinity) and the preparation and
      dissemination of oceanic products and services. IGOSS is
      coordinated jointly by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
      Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
      and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Meteorological
      Organization (WMO), and consists of national facilities and
      services provided by participating member countries who share
      data for mutual benefit.

      The IGOSS system consists of three components: the IGOSS
      Observing System (IOS), the IGOSS Data Processing and Services
      System (IDPSS) and the IGOSS Telecommunications Arrangements
      (ITA). In the IOS, naval ships, research vessels, and merchant
      ships in the Ships-of-Opportunity Programme (SOOP) along with
      fixed and floating buoys transmit oceanographic data such as
      subsurface temperature and salinity in near-real time. The IDPSS
      consists of several types of national, specialized and world
      data centres for processing and dissemination data and data
      products. The backbone of the ITA is the Global
      Telecommunication System (GTS) of the WMO. BATHY and TESAC data
      reports are transmitted over the GTS with headers that
      correspond to the nation which made the observation and placed
      the data on the GTS. The principal of free and open data
      exchange for all member states is accomplished through the GTS.

      Through IGOSS, observations, analyses and predictions of
      important ocean features are available to users on an
      operational basis, normally within 30 days or less. Ocean
      observations of temperature, salinity, sea level, and currents
      have a wide range of applications to commercial fishing,
      hydrobiology, marine exloration, disaster prevention, marine
      pollution and ocean modeling. IGOSS-derived data are used for
      both operational and research applications. The data are quality
      controlled at sea, by member states who acquired the data and at
      data centres where they are archived. Data monitoring is
      performed on a routine basis by the IGOSS Operations
      Co-ordinator and a series of Data Monitoring and Statistical
      Reports are available by FTP and via e-mail on the internet.

      The most notable success of processing and quality controlling
      global sets of temperature and salinity data is the Global
      Temperature Salinity Profile Programme (GTSPP) There are also
      groups such as the Group of Experts on Communications and
      Products(GE/C&amp;P) and the Task Team on Quality Control of
      Automated Systems (TT/QCAS) that are comprised of experts from
      member states that evaluate existing and new technologies for
      acquiring more and improved oceanographic data, review WMO codes
      and code tables for transmitting the data, and provide guidance
      on equipment problems and corrections.

      IGOSS products are disseminated promptly through the GTS and by
      radio, radio facsimile, and various electronic and hard copy
      mail systems. The IGOSS Products Bulletin, established in 1991,
      compiles and publishes IGOSS global and regional products as a
      valuable service to the scientific community and international
      programmes.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">COUNTRY FOOD SAFETY</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Engaging communities in the monitoring of zoonoses, country food safety and wildlife health.</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The food-borne parasites Trichinella nativa, Toxoplasma gondii, and Anisakis simplex are significant Arctic human zoonoses; endemic to some regions and directly related to the consumption of country foods. Many Northerners remain reliant on wildlife as a source of food, financial income and cultural identity and are demanding programs which will provide greater security in the safety of country foods and programs that ensure the long-term sustainability of wildlife populations. Changing climatic conditions are predicted to alter wildlife habitat, facilitate the northward migration of wildlife diseases and parasites, and alter contaminant cycling and fate; all of which have the potential to detrimentally affect the health and long term sustainability of wildlife populations and ultimately the source and safety of country foods (ACIA 2004; Boonstra 2004; Derocher et al. 2003; Harvell et al., 2002; Hoberg et al., 2002; Kutz et al. 2004; Lie et al. 2004 &amp; 2005). Adequate baseline data (benchmarks) regarding the current health conditions of wildlife (including zoonotic pathogens) is therefore urgently needed for the assessment and prediction of wildlife health impacts resulting from the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors associated with climate change and exposure to anthropogenic contaminants.

Issues regarding potential impacts to Arctic wildlife health and the safety of country foods are complex and will require an integrated approach from a wide range of scientific and social disciplines. The work outlined in this proposal will integrate well in a supportive manner with other IPY proposals (710, 742, 364, 261- Canadian #, and 231) focussed on wildlife health and social aspects.

During 2007 to 2009 we propose the following:
Overall objectives –
1. Document distribution and abundance of Trichinella nativa, Toxoplasma gondii, and Anisakis simplex in Arctic/subarctic wildlife.
2. Develop community capacity for ongoing detection and monitoring of above zoonotic pathogens through the development of a community-based testing program in order to provide Northerners rapid information regarding the safety of harvested country foods. This program will build upon other currently existing initiatives such as the Nunavik and Nunavut Trichinellosis Prevention Programs with the purpose enhancing the science, and broadening the present scope of services and capacity building within the communities. Once this framework is established it will be expanded to monitoring a variety of biological ‘indicators’ in various wildlife species in order to begin the process of establishing baseline benchmarks regarding wildlife health by engaging local hunters from selected communities to report on general health indices (i.e., body condition, behavior, pathogen observations). The collection of wildlife health indices will be modeled after the Nunavut Wildlife Health Assessment project and the Shatu Community based monitoring program which have been administered by investigators of this current proposal.
3. Facilitate the collection of wildlife samples for other researchers outside of this project. It is recognized that the collective impact of multiple IPY research request to northern communities will present a daunting task to local Hunter and Trapper Organizations / Associations within Canada, and similar organizations in other circumpolar locations. We propose to help avoid duplication of sampling effort by working in a liaison manner with the local hunter organization and northern communities for which we have already established a measure of familiarity and trust.

SCAR-MarBIN integrates these efforts, giving a single and easy access to
relevant marine biodiversity information and maximizing the exploitation of
these resources.

SCAR-MarBIN will leave a valuable legacy for future generations, in the form of
an information tool that will provide a baseline reference for establishing a
State of Antarctic Environment, and predicting the future for marine
communities around Antarctica, which are currently facing global change.
SCAR-MarBIN is the companion-project of the Census of Antarctic Marine Life
(CAML), an ambitious 5-year project which aims at assessing the nature,
distribution and abundance of the Southern Ocean biodiversity. CAML will focus
the attention of the public on the ice-bound oceans of Antarctica during the
International Polar Year (IPY) in 2007/08. SCAR-MarBIN will handle biodiversity
data arising from CAML field projects.

SCAR-MarBIN is implemented within the Belgian Biodiversity Platform (BBPF).
SCAR-MarBIN is supported by the Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO), the Alfred P.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: NORLAKES 4 Future 
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=169

The network for present and future circumpolar freshwater lake research and data management (NORLAKES 4 Future) is a multidisciplinary and national network under the International Polar Year initiative that seek to connect activities and data of complementary research groups that are or will perform limnological research in the Arctic.

Background. The polar regions at the Northern hemisphere have myriads of freshwater lakes that are integrated parts of the polar biome and thus are irrevocable sites for many ecosystem processes. 
Arctic lakes are unique in a number of ways. The most obvious being the physical and chemical conditions that often imply a very harsh environment with low nutrient variability, low temperatures, long ice coverage and highly variable microclimate. The biodiversity as well as productivity of species in such lakes is often low and the food web structures often simple. This implies that arctic lakes are vulnerable to disturbance of almost any kind (air pollution, over exploitation, acidification, eutrophication and climate changes). 
Freshwater lakes are essential in many ways as they provide breeding habitats for birds, are the nursing ground for many insect larval stages, host valuable fish populations (salmon, charr and trout), act as buffer zones for melt waters, provides drinking water and transportation corridors for wild life and humans.
Recent studies have shown that the coupling between pelagic and benthic food webs in arctic aquatic environments is very important for the cycling of organic matter. It is also clear that the low productivity of most Arctic lakes forces the biota to a very efficient utilization of recourses and that prey-predator interactions work in a strong manner.

Rationale and goal. As clearly stated in the ACIA documents it is necessary to improve and the understanding of ecosystem structure, food web behaviour and productivity in Arctic ecosystems along geographical gradients in order to enables the best management practices and protection of such ecosystems for the future. This applies also to the freshwater systems that are essential components in the terrestrial biome as well as a connection between land and sea. The establishment of a strong circumpolar freshwater research network within the IPY is seen as way forward to facilitate the present and future understanding and thus preservation of these ecosystems.
The most significant advances within the framework of IPY will be to enforce the research, educational and communication relationships across countries and cultures in the Arctic region. By bringing researcher together that are expects in their fields and/or regions, the network will be able to provide a profound base of knowledge of physical, chemical and biological characteristics of lakes in the Arctic region. By including young scientist as well as training aspect this initiative foster a new generation of scientists that are prepared to take action in international decision and research communities. 
The networking activities will also include joint expeditions that serve to exploit areas previously not studied because of logistic and/or resources reasons and to share technical and scientific skills between research teams that are not yet co-working. 

Clustering. The network consists of an already established Nordic collaboration network that has wished to open up to become a multidisciplinary and -national networking unit that will aim at coordinate complementary research groups that are or will perform limnological research in the Arctic. The partner consortium is formed by unifying the original EoI#539, that was assigned by IPY to become a lead project by several other EoI´s that were relevant including two EoI (#313 and 429) that have formed their own clusters but have expressed wished to coordinate activities where it is possible.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=213

There is increasing recognition that multiple environmental changes are occurring in the northern regions of Europe. Some of these environmental changes, for example climate warming, levels of UV-B radiation, and habitat fragmentation, are projected to continue leading to impacts on the lands of the Nordic countries unprecedented since deglaciation some 10,000 year ago. 

There will likely be large impacts on the peoples of the North, both problems and opportunities, and consequences outside the region because of the important role that the Arctic plays in the earth system: changes in treeline and snow and ice cover affect the transfer of energy and water between land and atmosphere; changes in vegetation, soils and permafrost affect the atmospheric composition of greenhouse gases; millions of birds that breed and feed in the Arctic are important winter components of the biodiversity of European countries further south. Although some arctic Nordic observatories such as the Abisko Station have monitored the environment for nearly 100 years, and much research has been initiated within the last decade, our baseline information on multiple and often interacting environmental changes is still weak and our ability to project impacts of future environmental changes on ecosystems and the land surface at the landscape scale is poor. However, it is the landscape scale of changes that is relevant to people. 

Aims
A new collaborative, co-ordinated programme is required to:
-provide a standardised, georeferenced baseline of environmental information, including statistics and processes, against which changes throughout the current century can be measured, 
-develop models of climate, land use, biodiversity and ecosystem function that can be inter-linked and applied to landscape level projections
-establish standardised monitoring that can detect change at multiple local sites and that can validate model projections and remotely sensed data.

Strategy 
An &amp;expedition&amp; to northernmost Sweden will be arranged in which international scientists will be offered logistic support to join Abisko researchers working in the field. The research will be focused on large scale land-freshwater-atmospheric exchange studies at the catchment scale, and will include scientists from several natural science disciplines (such as plant ecology, bio-geochemistry, hydrology, biodiversity, GIS, remote science, meteorology etc). The bio-geo modelling community will be involved, particularly for upscaling. 

The local Swedish indigenous people, the Saami , will be invited to host members of the indigenous peoples from around the Arctic to discuss and initiate collaboration on environmental issues and monitoring.

Joint meetings of the scientists working in the field, computer modellers and indigenous peoples will be arranged for cross-fertilisation and collaboration on environmental process understanding, monitoring and assessment, and projection of environmental change and its impacts.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Recently it has been proposed that the phase delay associated with the radio signals propagating from GPS satellites to a ground-based GPS receiving station can be used to infer the vertically integrated water vapor (precipitable water-PW) with a high degree of accuracy. Since a ground-based GPS receiving station is relatively inexpensive, a specially designed, dense GPS network can provide PW measurements with unprecedented coverage. Such a dataset can potentially have a significant impact on operational numerical weather prediction. In this paper, a series of numerical experiments were conducted using a variational (4DVAR) data assimilation system based on The Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research mesoscale model MM5 and its adjoint. The special soundings collected in SESAME (Severe Environmental Storms and Mesoscale Experiment) 1979 were used in two sets of experiments. In the first set, a 1-h assimilation window and an analysis of the observed PW data were used. All data were assumed to be available at the end of the assimilation window.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The membership of SCAR comprises the appropriate bodies of those national scientific academies or research councils which are the adhering bodies to ICSU and which are, or plan to be, active in Antarctic research, together with the relevant scientific Unions of ICSU. It includes the original twelve members and an increasing number of subsequent members.

There are three categories of membership: Full Members, ICSU scientific unions members and Associate Members. Full Members are those countries with active scientific research programme in Antarctica, currently 31; union members are those ICSU scientific unions that have an interest in Antarctic research, currently 9; and Associate Members are those countries without an independent research programme as yet or which are planning a research programme in the future, currently 4. In addition, there are the Honorary Members of SCAR; those individuals who have, over many years, rendered outstanding service to SCAR and scientific research in Antarctica.

The National Committee of each Full Member of SCAR appoints a Permanent Delegate and an Alternate Delegate to SCAR; ICSU Unions appoint a single Union Delegate; and Associate Members appoint a Delegate. These delegates attend the bi-ennial SCAR Delegates Meeting but only the Permanent and Union Delegates may vote.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Accelerated Canopy Chemistry Program (ACCP) was an investigation to determine the theoretical and empirical basis for remote sensing of nitrogen and lignin concentrations in vegetation canopies of different ecosystems. The study focused on chemical composition, spectral analysis, and remote sensing.

Approximately 1000 leaf samples from fresh forest foliage were collected from 5 geographically distinct sites and analyzed at the University of New Hampshire to determine carbon constituents (non-polar, polar, cellulose, and lignin) content using a series of extractions, and nitrogen content using a standard combustion procedure. Results were used as a calibration set for Visible/NIR reflectance and the estimation of carbon and nitrogen concentrations at both the leaf and canopy level. The canopy level study used high spectral resolution data from NASA's AVIRIS to estimate canopy level nitrogen and lignin concentration for the study sites.

Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (OAII) research seeks to understand
the arctic marine environment and its role in climate and global
change. The arctic marine environment is an interactive system
comprising the water, ice, air, biota, dissolved chemicals, and
sediments of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. Through feedback
processes that are only partially understood, this system has a
significant impact on global climate, and in turn is highly sensitive
to environmental perturbations originating elsewhere.

The National Lewis and Clark Education Project (NLCEP) engages
educators in a dynamic understanding of The Lewis and Clark
expedition (1803-1806) and the nature of the trail's historical
and modern landscapes. To achieve these objectives, The
Education Project utilizes advanced education technologies,
integrates interdisciplinary curricula into the classroom,
supports scholarly dialogue and develops multimedia geographical
data accessible through the Internet.  Utilizing our 40 station
mobile computing lab, conference facilities at The University of
Montana, a robust, interactive web presence, and remote teacher
workshop capabilities, The Education Project reaches out to a
wide educational audience and supports Lewis and Clark education
programs across the country.

The Education Project explores landscape change and develops a
variety of tools that assist educators in determining the
cultural and ecological interactions inherent in this
change. Comparing contemporary and historical interpretations of
the trail provides a framework for the integration of remote
sensing imagery, Geographic Information System (GIS), and Global
Positioning System (GPS) technologies. Collectively, these new
classroom technologies support interdisciplinary curricula and
contextual documentation.

The Education Project aggregates geographical, historical, and
ecological information, advanced technologies, and field-based
interpretation. As a national resource for educators interested
in the Lewis and Clark expedition, The Education Project pursues
cooperative alliances with multiple Lewis and Clark programs
across the country and facilities the important exchange of
ideas and classroom resources across boundaries.

The National Lewis and Clark Education Project invites other
organizations, institutions and peoples involved in preparations
for the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial (2003-2006) to participate
in this Lewis and Clark education cooperative. Working closely
with private and public sector pioneers in technology and
educational content, The Education Project serves a national
constituency and seeks to enhance the spirit of collaboration
shared by all parties participating in the commemoration of the
"Corps of Discovery".

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Coordinated Enhanced ObservingPeriod (CEOP) seeks to establish an integrated global observing system for the water cycle which responds to both scientific and social needs. It is built as the foundation of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization(WMO) and Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) under the framework of the Integrated Global Observing Strategy partnership (IGOS-P).

Objectives:

CEOP is an effort to address some of the critical aspects of the climate system involving land areas in particular over a 2 year period beginning in mid-2001. It will focus on two overall issues: 1) water and energy fluxes and reservoirs over land areas, and 2) monsoonal circulations. CEOP will involve the simultaneous or near-simultaneous collection of observations from several regions around the world. In particular, it will include: 1) several reference sites in the continental-scale experimental regions of GEWEX as well as other regions, 2) extensive field measurements for addressing monsoonal systems, and 3) validation studies for new satellite systems CEOP will lead to: 1) better understanding of water and energy fluxes and reservoirs over specific land areas, 2) progress at better appreciating the role of land areas in the whole climate system, 3) a testing of our capabilities to transfer techniques and models between different GEWEX continental-scale experimental (and other) regions and to predict water-related parameters and, 4) enhanced understanding of the land-atmosphere-ocean interactions. CEOP Enhanced Observing Period 1 (EOP-1) covers the time period from 1 July 2001 through 30 September 2001.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Arctic Portal Developed by Arctic Council and Affiliates</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: Arctic Portal
Project URL: http://www.arcticportal.net/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=388


Though the creation of the Arctic Portal concept, ( a web portal, accessible through the internet, focused on the Arctic and the Arctic Council ) the feasibility study, and preliminary design elements originate within the Arctic Council, and it is the Arctic Council that will launch the Arctic Portal, the Portal has four main components: 
Arctic Council:
The Arctic Portal will enable the Arctic Council to operate more efficiently, maximizing limited financial and human resources. It will serve to enhance the operations of the Working Groups, Permanent Participants (Indigenous Peoples Organizations), and Observer countries and organizations. It will provide a means for the Working Groups and their Secretariats to establish better communication and cooperation on those elements of day-to-day operations that they share in common, such as a common calendar, joint project directory, and on-line document library, none of which currently exist. The Arctic Portal will also allow for the Arctic Council to hold virtual meetings. This will enable better meeting attendance by the Indigenous Peoples Organizations and other interested stakeholders who have limited financial and staff resources. 
Professional/Scientific: 
The Arctic Portal may serve as a main storage of data and provide interactive working venues on the web for research projects in the Arctic, including those of the Arctic Council Working Groups, providing data management and analysis capabilities. Two such projects, submitted as IPY projects are the CBMP and COMAAR. Remote sensing data, and GIS-mapping will now be possible as well through the Arctic Portal, and it will link data from the different Working Groups and scientific projects in the Arctic more easily and cost-effectively. Professionals located across the globe will have better access to data and information sharing through this Portal, including the use of virtual meetings and access to password-protected draft documents. This is especially relevant with Working Group Assessments which involve experts from many different regions, not just the Arctic.
Indigenous Peoples Organizations/Communities:
The Arctic Portal will serve the Indigenous Peoples Organizations of the Arctic Council as well as other Arctic Indigenous communities. It will provide a gateway into a multi-media/multi-lingual site where culture, history and language can be shared and preserved. Stories, maps and photographs of sacred sites, customs, and historical facts can be shared using audio, video, and photography. In addition, this is where important issues of concern can be presented, such as climate change and the changes in migration patterns of species on which livelihoods depend. It will be a tool to help with regional development issues and will communicate many different levels of information, for primary and secondary education up to national and regional governments and policymakers. Intellectual property rights will be correctly addressed with all such information put on the Arctic Portal. 
General Public:
The Arctic Portal will make it much easier to download and order Arctic publications using the online document library. It will also provide basic information about the Arctic and its residents, species of flora and fauna, the state of the environment and the current issues being addressed by researchers and policy makers in a simple format for use by educators and the general public. Different maps of the Arctic countries can be made easily available, as well as publications for the public by national agencies of each of the Arctic countries. A general calendar of events will be created to serv the interest of the general public, professionals and other interested stakeholders.

GIS client:
CHRONOS is integrating the Cartoweb open source cross platform GIS client into the geospatially enabled data sources. The goal is to connect data searched geospatially into the other searches (text and time based) at the CHRONOS site. Also we will connect these with external open data source reachable via service calls. Integrating searches regardless of the user interface is a goal to address the need for researchers to quickly and effectively locate data related to their research efforts.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: CBMP
Project URL: http://arcticportal.org/en/caff/cbmp
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=133

What is the CBMP?
- The CBMP is an international network of key scientists and conservation experts from 8 Arctic countries, including indigenous organizations. 
- It collaborates to document the dramatic changes in the North, why these changes occur and what can be done about them.

Why is the CBMP needed?
- Public interest in Global Change is high and increasing. Key question: What is happening to the climate and the environment, particularly in the North where changes are predicted to be most intense. 
- Political support is high: Environment Ministers from all 8 Arctic countries ordered in November 2004 that a CBMP be launched as soon as possible.
- Good circumpolar information is needed to make the best conservation decisions as pressures on the Arctic increase.
- With the international polar year coming up in 2007, timing is right to ramp up monitoring efforts on a circumpolar basis.
- Collaboration increases efficiency and impact of conservation work, compared to each country working alone on these issues. 

Where is the CBMP at?
- The CBMP has just been officially launched on Sept 8, 2005, at an international meeting in Cambridge, England
- The Cambridge meeting also achieved the following:
o Brought together almost 60 key arctic scientists and conservation experts
o Selected a suite of 12 indicator areas to be monitored
o Developed a data management strategy
o Confirmed collaboration with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre as the main data hub
o Established remote sensing and community monitoring task teams
o Confirmed financial support from Microsoft Research for up to 5 years and substantial in kind and monetary support from Canada
o Confirmed Canada as the lead country for the CBMP 
o Established an international secretariat for the CBMP with full time staff to oversee implementation of the program

What are the next steps and longer term goals?
- Stepping up circumpolar monitoring efforts to document changes in Arctic Biodiversity
- Monitor key drivers of change and a suite of 12 key indicators
- Report on why biodiversity is changing and what can be done about it
- Develop a web portal that displays monitoring information and policy advise
- Development of a Polar Global Environmental Outlook report.
- Develop a high profile Arctic Biodiversity Assessment by 2010

The International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project's purposes
are to understand how the chemistry of the global atmosphere is regulated,
and what the role of biological processes is in producing and consuming
trace gases.
IGAC addresses the relationships between atmospheric composition, physical
and biospheric processes and climate. Emphasis is on the atmospheric
constituents that have a role in global climate control: greenhouse gases
(such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide); aerosols and cloud
condensation nuclei; and ozone and other trace reactive gases and
radicals. The project also includes work on global emission inventories,
measurement intercalibration and standards, the establishment of global
monitoring networks, and modelling.
IGAC's research activities fall into the following eight focus areas:
1. Natural Variability and Anthropogenic Perturbations of the Marine
Atmosphere
2. Natural Variability and Anthropogenic Perturbations of Tropical
Atmospheric Chemistry
3. The Role of Polar Regions in Changing Atmospheric Composition
4. The Role of Boreal Regions in Biosphere-Atmosphere Interactions
5. Trace Gas Fluxes in Mid-Latitude Ecosystems
6. Global Distributions, Transformations, Trends and Modeling
7. Fundamental Activities
8. Atmospheric Aerosols

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The understanding of Antarctica's climate, cryosphere, and biosphere evolution is limited, which is due in part to the paucity of outcrops and cores that record changes during the Tertiary. This problem has been partially rectified using conventional drill ships, such as the JOIDES Resolution, but access to key areas of the continental margin has been restricted because of the inability of these ships to operate in ice-covered waters. While researchers are restricted in their ability to acquire long cores in ice-prone areas, nature has provided an alternative method.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The international Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) was formed to provide a consistent, standardized set of long-term measurements of atmospheric trace gases, particles, and physical parameters via a suite of globally distributed sites. It is composed of more than 70 high-quality, remote-sensing research stations for observing and understanding the physical and chemical state of the stratosphere and upper troposphere and for assessing the impact of stratosphere changes on the underlying troposphere and on global climate.  While the NDACC remains committed to monitoring changes in the stratosphere with an emphasis on the long-term evolution of the ozone layer, its priorities have broadened considerably to encompass issues such as the detection of trends in overall atmospheric composition and understanding their impacts on the stratosphere and troposphere, and establishing links between climate change and atmospheric composition.  Following five years of planning, instrument design and implementation, the NDACC began network operations in January 1991.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">CRAC-ICE will be a coordinated investigation into calving processes on three major Antarctic ice shelves, and a (long-term) monitoring of icebergs in the Southern Ocean, including the study of the physical processes related to iceberg drift and decay. The processes leading to a calving event include the initiation and propagation of through-cutting rifts. Iceberg calving can result in a significant loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet, and represents ~ 65% of the total ice sheet ablation. Therefore, it is critical to understand the processes which precede and lead up to a major calving event in order to realistically assess how future climate changes might affect the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Post-calving, iceberg drift is influenced by the shape of the coastline, bottom topography, and a combination of tides, currents, wind, and sea ice. Monitoring the evolution of icebergs as they drift into warmer waters provides a valuable experiment in how rapid climate change influences ice shelves – especially such components as firn compaction, the impact of surface meltwater, ponding, and iceberg break-up. Grounded icebergs cause a severe devastation of the sea floor, forcing benthic communities to re-colonise. Iceberg melting and decay represents a significant source of freshwater (and mineral dust) primarily into the upper layers of the Southern Ocean's northern fringe. A stabilisation of the weakly stratified water column has important and poorly understood consequences for sea ice and water masses involved in deep and bottom water formation, and the biology of the euphotic zone.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Joint North Sea Data Acquisition Project (JONSDAP 76) was an
international undertaking in the North Sea during March to June
1976. It consisted of two parts: FLEX, the Fladen Ground Experiment,
and INOUT, the inflows of water of the whole North Sea as well as the
internal movements.

The INOUT period was 15 March to 25 April. Automatically ... recording
current (and usually temperature) meters were deployed at 83 positions
and off-shore tide gauges at 11 positions. More than 10 ships carried
out hydrographic work at various stations.

The FLEX period was 25 March to 15 June. The central position in the
FLEX square was continually occupied by at least one (German)
ship. During the latter half of the period there was increased
activity from about 15 ships. There were nearly 20 positions with more
than 80 automatically recording instruments (some overlapping with
INOUT) and 15 over-flights with aircraft.

The moored current meter data collected during JONSDAP 76 have been
compiled into a data set comprising approximately 250 data series. The
data were collected by 13 laboratories in 8 countries.

The data set is available from BODC on magnetic tape, floppy disk or
via ftp over Internet.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=390

Spiders are important general predators of insects and other arthropods in all terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. In addition they are an important food source for smaller vertebrates, like birds. Therefore they act as important key nodes in the arctic food web. The proposed project aims at an extensive documentation of the current status of arctic spider biodiversity and genetic diversity and at the evaluation of climate change-driven modification of spider lifecycles.

Arctic spider biodiversity has been addressed selectively, but not yet comprehensively. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that the assessment of spider diversity allows to conclude on the diversity of all arthropods in a given habitat. In addition, spiders, especially lycosids (wolf spiders), are valid model organisms for the monitoring of climate change impact on arctic habitats and their microclimate. In fact, spiders adapt their lifecycle frequencies to microclimatic conditions. Since in the arctic lifecycles take up to several years, changes will almost instantly be assessable by analysis of the life stages present. 

Our aim is to combine an arctic-wide spider biodiversity survey and the monitoring of climate induced lifecycle changes in a set of model species at several circum-arctic locations. For the first aim, surveys will be conducted at a selected set of locations, to assess data across the arctic, partly linked to existing stations and other IPY reference sites and projects. In addition, we try to extend our resolution by including students of the whole arctic via the GLOBE project. Collected specimens will be identified by spider taxonomy experts, and characterized using molecular markers for a subset of samples, to address genetic diversity. 

On the long-term, dynamics of species and genetic biodiversity, shall be addressed. This will allow to estimate speed of speciation in the arctic and the time of isolation between distant populations. We will extend existing field methodologies, e.g. pitfall trapping, by establishing complementary new ones, which allow direct monitoring of microclimate changes in arctic habitats. 

Major methodologies will be: (1) pitfall trap and hand collection, classic taxonomy, voucher specimen deposition in museum collections, assembly of a biodiversity database. (2) Microclimate measurements and correlation to biodiversity data. (3) morphometric and statistic lifecycle analysis based on pitfall trap data for selected species of the lycosids. (4) Long term RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based remote sensing of microchip tagged spiders (lycosids) in semi-closed experimental plots, in order to address activity data, which will be correlated as a baseline to pitfall trap data and allow to record minor activities during winter and cold periods. (5) Manipulated test plots (artificial heating, etc.), in order to simulate microclimate induced lifecycle changes in lycosids directly. (6) Genetic analysis of distant populations, latitudinal and longitudinal. 

For most activities, instant setup at several circum-arctic locations is possible. The RFID-technique will have to be tested first at one location. At a later phase, a standardized setup can be implemented into a variety of circum-arctic locations. All data will be linked to microclimate data as well as general climate data and will be made available to the general public via databases and scientific publications.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=446
Over a million indigenous people inhabit the circumpolar Arctic. Understandably, one of their main priorities over the past decade has been to improve their social and economic well-being and increase their political voice. However, in light of the ominous predictions about the impacts of global warming on the Arctic ecosystem and the recent rash of catastrophic natural events in both hemispheres, there is growing recognition that significant attention also needs to be paid to protecting the natural environment, which is the third component of sustainable development. For this, much of the burden will fall to the youth who make up well over 50% of the Arctic's indigenous populations and are acknowledged as one of the world's fastest growing demographic groups. 

As they move into adulthood, these young people will soon be faced with the challenge of achieving sustainable livelihoods while protecting their natural environment and conserving its ecological resources and integrity. This will mean making hard choices between oft-competing land and resource uses while maintaining a healthy and reasonable balance between economic, environmental, cultural and social goals. Their task will be further compounded by differing social perceptions and by economic, political and environmental decisions made in multinational and global fora. To help them better face these challenges, it is prudent to begin equipping them with the proper knowledge and skills they will need to make informed decisions on their environment and on sustainable resource use, to acquaint them with global and regional environmental instruments and issues and to engage them early in the ongoing processes, dialogue and debates. This Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Project consists of three inter-related components designed to achieve these goals. 

The three components of the Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Project are:

- A series of Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Workshops to a) better familiarise indigenous youth from the north with contemporary conservation and sustainable use issues and instruments, b) provide them with an opportunity to exchange ideas on the environment and on conservation, and c) seek their input on priorities and future directions for this pilot Circumpolar Conservation Project. A preliminary design for Workshop I has been completed. The executing agency for this component will be the Toronto Zoo.

- An updateable two-part Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Guide to a) educate and inform young indigenous people on the various global and regional conservation instruments, programmes and organisations relevant to the north, and b) provide an overview of important conservation issues and challenges of particular relevance for northern indigenous peoples. A preliminary design for the two parts of the Guide has been prepared. The executing agency for this component will be Twin Dolphins.

- A pilot Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Network, initially set up on a trial basis, to a) provide a participatory mechanism for northern indigenous youth to become more involved and engaged in conservation issues and debates, b) integrate them into the processes of conservation and c) to provide them with an ongoing opportunity for dialogue and input. This component is being addressed from both a technical and a content standpoint. It will be carried out in three phases beginning with a Technical Experts Meeting, followed by a Feasibility Study and by a Trial Implementation and Evaluation phase to be carried out in co-operation with several northern schools across the Arctic. A preliminary description of the phases of Component III has been prepared and investigations are now underway to select the appropriate agencies and schools to execute the Network component.

Note: The project proponents are currently investigating the potential of adding a fourth component as a corollary to this Project. This would be a circumpolar network of ex-situ conservation facilities to include, inter alia, the Toronto Zoo and zoos from other countries with expertise in Arctic conservation. These facilities would supplement, complement and enhance the education and outreach components of the Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Project. The project proponents are currently investigating adding this as a corollary component. 

This Project is consistent with and responds to the overall objectives of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Implementation Plan; the Millennium Development Goals and Strategy; the UN Decade of Education; and is consistent with the goals and objectives of major Regional and Global Conservation Instruments and Programmes

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=267

COMPASS provides an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the input of Antarctica into global climate formation during the observation period of IPY 2007-2008. COMPASS is realised through following four themes:
1. Records of Antarctic climate variability and change
2. Climate processes at the Antarctic central and coastal zones
3. Southern Hemisphere teleconnections and land - air - sea - ice interactions
4. Antarctica and the global climate system

The COMPASS Project cluster has the goal of creating a definitive, high quality data set of IPY Antarctic standard meteorological observations for use in climate research and applied studies. The project results will be freely available to the Antarctic community. The primary source of COMPASS Project data will be the netwoirk of Antarctic manned research stations and automatic weather stations (AWSs) being actively operating during IPY period observational period.
This proposal describes IPY activities grouped in the Antarctic Meteorology cluster of EOIs that contribute to the goals of COMPASS.

Objectives:
1. To obtain a synoptic circumpolar snapshot of the atmospheric environment of the Southern Hemisphere (collaboration with other IPY activities will extend the snapshot to include solar radiation, trace gases, permafrost and geomagnetism).
2. To enhance understanding of the role of the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric processes in present climate, including teleconnections between polar and lower latitudes, connections between synoptic, mesoscale and large-scale circulation systems, solar radiation cloudy feedbacks, greenhouse gases emission, land - air- - sea - ice interactions.

Outcomes/Deliverables:
1. Improved description of atmosphere features for a better understanding of southern polar climate processes.
2. Proof of concept of a viable, cost-effective, sustained observing system for the southern polar regions (including land, atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere).
3. A baseline for the assessment of future climate change.

Major field programs:
1. A circumpolar data set of full multi-disciplinary measurement program with extending from the Antarctic continent northward to Sub-Antarctic Islands, including current surface (00, 06, 12, 18 GMT) and upper-air observations (00, 12, GMT) (totally about 120 synoptic parameters).
2. An enhanced circumpolar dataset of solar radiation measurements, including UV-B radiation variability based on surface observations, satellite data and model estimations.
3. An enhanced circumpolar dataset of cloud cover parameters variability, including number of cloudy levels, top and bottom boundary height of clouds, water content of clouds and so on (totally about 40 parameters) based on surface observations, upper-air data diagnosis, satellite information, lidar measurements (EOI 757).
4. An enhanced circumpolar dataset of precipitation and snow cover parameters variability, including precipitation correction procedure.
5. Greenhouse gases dataset formation, based on surface and satellite data.
6. Dataset on atmospheric aerosol composition and distribution.
7. Automatic Weather Stations information and data quality control.
8. Atmospheric boundary layer turbulent flux measurements (EOI 805).
9. Synoptic map collection and macro-scale circulation form classification.

The observations will be integrated closely with modelling studies using a variety of approaches (global and regional atmospheric models, photo-chemical models, coupled climate models (EOI 582)).

Two types of urban surface geometry have been investigated. One is large square/staggered arrays of uniform building with various areal densities (Experiment-1), and the other is a real 3-D building geometry using GIS-data of Tokyo Metropolitan area (Experiment-2).

The purpose of the Experiment-1 is to obtain basic knowledge for making simple urban canopy models for meso-scale simulations. First, a passive scalar was released at a constant flux from all constituent surfaces under fully-developed turbulent flows, and then a dataset of relative value of local transfer coefficients of each constituent surface was constructed for a wide range of simple building arrays. Second, simulations with a constant heat flux to one of the constituent surfaces (four vertical walls, roof, and floor, respectively) were performed. The results revealed that the heating of windward-wall generates significantly larger Reynolds stress than the heating of the other surfaces even though the heat fluxes per unit lot area are all the same.

COHMEX was conducted in the vicinity of Huntsville, Alabama during
June-July, 1986. The objectives of this field experiment were to
investigate the morphology, dynamics, microphysics, and electrical
evolution of storms and the relation of storm electrical activity to
precipitation and dynamical processes. The primary instrumentation
used in quantifying storm electrification included the ER-2 LIP,
4-station MSFC lightning direction finder network, NCAR research
radars, and T-28 field mills.

SCCWRP is a joint powers agency focusing on marine environmental
research. A joint powers agency is one that is formed when several
government agencies have a common mission that can be better addressed
by pooling resources and knowledge. In our case, the common mission is
to gather the necessary scientific information so that our member
agencies can effectively, and cost-efficiently, protect the Southern
California marine environment.

An important part of our mission is to ensure that the data we collect
and synthesize effectively reaches decision-makers, scientists and the
public. The world-wide web provides us a new opportunity to achieve
this goal.

Since 1997, this Observation Service is supported by three Institutes (INSU, IPEV and IPSL). This program sets up a network coupled oceanic and atmospheric observations on long time to identify and quantify oceanic CO2 sources and sinks variations , to understand air-sea CO2 exchanges from one season to another, from one year to another, to estimate the evolution of these exchanges in response to climatic changes and to identify carbon anthropic in the ocean and its evolution (bonds with the research programs). In addition to detailed study of CO2 oceanic cycle in Indian and southern south-western zone, the data collected at the time during OISO campaigns are usable to force and to validate oceanic models (e.g. IPSL/IM), the atmospheric models reverse and assimilable in the predictive approaches.
The recognition of the responsible processes in CO2 oceanic cycle variations requires a multiannual follow-up and pluridécennal same area. For logistic reasons, choice of a long-term follow-up is fixed on the oceanic zones covered by the ways of Marion-Dufresne rotations in the Indian Ocean, ship chartered by IPEV.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=337

Life in the Arctic is changing very fast, and there are serious problems behind the façade of its modernization process. High rates of morbidity and mortality, increased migration, unemployment and crisis of the native economies are taking place in many Arctic countries along with aggravated environmental problems  contamination and degradation of the natural environment, rapid climate change, and shrinking of the pristine and traditional land use areas. Interdependence of social, economic and environmental problems, with their particular manifestations in the regions of traditional subsistence by indigenous peoples, require development of specific methods of scientific inquiry, aimed at understanding the various national and local approaches to their solutions. Northern populations, depending upon how they are recognized within a wide variety of legal and political frameworks, thereby obtain access to land-based resources. The immemorial presence of people on the land has often provided the justification for their confirmed rights or stipulated privileges (an important distinction) with regard to land use. Once states have defined who can access land resources and what kinds of usage such access might entail, however, a circular dynamic is formed whereby categories of people (and even historically well-defined groups) aspire to be "recognized" according to these legal criteria. The concept of  "indigenous people" has come to mean different things in different countries and to be associated with a wide variety of accompanying land use regulations. Even the size of a defined ethnic group can be of significance with respect to resource use, as in Russia where placement of peoples on the list of the "small peoples of the North" holds great significance for their land rights and development, but might also thereby come to disqualify them from membership in a larger group with certain rights of political autonomy. In effect, there are compelling reasons for how groups manage to present themselves and different strategies that must be employed according to the different criteria established by their encompassing states. Similarly, the distinction between group and category is also open to strategic negotiation. In the West, new Indian tribes have been "constructed" in order to form effective lobbies for environmental protection. This ongoing circular dynamic whereby historical land use has come to define people, and the definition of people has come to define their land use rights, is of essential significance to the sustainability of the human dimension in the North.
The proposed research methodology will be based on anthropological fieldwork accompanied by semi-structured sociological interviews of both members of local northern populations, members of their representative organizations and also government resource administrators. We shall seek to establish the current "rules of the game" with respect to definitions, eligibility criteria, and accompanying land rights/privileges. We will also seek to uncover the tensions between and within groups (haves and have nots) generated by these systems. We are interested in how, in effect, the system developed historically and politically. Current tensions will also outline the course of future changes. It is our conviction that these systems generate the seeds to their own future development. Hence research will focus upon current dissatisfactions and hopes and will also ask informants to speculate on possible corrective measures and what the effects of such measures might be if taken. We will thereby obtain material with a continuity of time depth as well as comparative material from different circumpolar countries. As each country deals with the much the same issues from different vantage points in national policy, and increasingly through similar foundations ratified in international conventions, such research into the pros and cons of various regulatory systems is essential.

We have been exchanging, archiving and distributing observational data of ionosphere since the IGY. In addition, We, NICT continue ionospheric observations as routine at four observatories, Wakkanai(45.4N, 141.7E), Kokubunji(35.7N, 139.5E), Yamagawa(31.2N, 130.6E) and Okinawa(26.3N, 127.8E) every 15 minutes since more than 50 years, and provide these ionogram data automatically. We need to scale the ionograms manually for precise use, but for quick look we prepare automatic scaling. These data contribute to scientific use and the operation of aviation, broadband and telecommunications etc. In addition, as a part of space weather activity of NICT, we are constructing the forecast of ionospheric activity with neural network method. We will show the detailed analysis and results of these activities.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=357

During last decades in the Euroarctic Region there is observed a stable tendency towards warming that enables us to assume that this is not a short-time deviations of the climatic system from the equilibrium but long-lasted changes. To main factors forming the climate of the Spitsbergen Archipelago one could refer its geographical location, atmospheric circulation, ocean impact, sea and continental ice sheet, complicated morphometrics.
On the Spitsbergen Archipelago there exists the huge mass of fresh water in a form of cryosphere elements (glaciers, snow cover, naleds), it has a specific biota and at the same time locates in the area of a relatively intensive economic activity compared with other Arctic Archipelagos... Thus, Cryosphere, Hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere of the Archipelago is a noticeable objects-indicator of the current status of the Arctic climate system and estimates of its future changes. Along with this Spitsbergen is a wonderful science platform for studying the overall spectrum of reactions of Polar Regions nature on the climate variations both of natural and anthropogenic origin.
Nowadays, a large complex of scientific researches and monitoring of the Spitsbergen Archipelago environment is carried out on the basis of the infrastructure of the Russian village Barents burg, Norwegian villages Longierbuen and New-Alesunn and also the Polish research base Hornsunn. Meteorological, aerological, ice, oceanographic, biological and other observations are performed.
It is considered to perform the following complex investigations of the Spitsbergen Archipelago environment in the framework of this project:
Main project goals are: 
- development and unification of the existing system of complex monitoring of the principal climate forming parameters of the environment status in the area of the Spitsbergen Archipelago 
estimation of the features of the present status of the principal components of the climatic and systems of the Archipelago and surrounding Euro-Arctic aquatic regions -on the basis of the analysis of databases obtained during the project implementation and historical Russian and available international databases ;
Understanding of the impact mechanisms of external climate factors on the nature of the Spitsbergen Archipelago;
development of the scientific basis of the scenarios of possible climate changes of the Archipelago environment and forecast of possible ecological impact;
- improvement of the technology and technical means for the system of hydrometeorological monitoring of the environment.
The investigations are complex ones. So, there are some separate sub-programs co-operating in the framework of general research program including the following directions:
-Meteorological regime;
-Hydrological regime of dry land;
-Energy-exchange processes between the atmosphere and underlying surface;
-Ice-cover evolution;
-Structure and dynamics of coastal waters including fiords; 
-Climate and fresh water balance;
-Sea-ice evolution; 
- Monitoring of contamination of air and water ambience
-Studies of the composite and concentration of radio-active gases in the atmosphere and ocean;
-Flora and fauna research;
-Validation of results from remote sounding of the environment components;
-Testing and experimental service of new measurement complexes for the Archipelago environment monitoring. 
Implementation of the above sub-programs will be realized on the basis of ZGMO «Baretsburg» (AARI, Murmansk ASMS), Norwegian research station in New Alesunn village (NPI) and Polish station in the Hornsunn Bay (Polish Academy of Sciences). Also it is assumed to perform, on the basis of the previous AARI field studies on the Archipelago, the constant-basis observations at a number of geographical objects (glaciers, lakes, river valleys, etc) for which there exist multi-year sets of field data. Here we suppose to use both automation measuring complexes and random observations using helicopters, sea- vehicles etc.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Chesapeake Bay Program is the unique regional partnership that's
been directing and conducting the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay
since the signing of the historic Chesapeake Bay Agreement of
1983. The Bay Program partners includethe states of Maryland,
Pennsylvania and Virginia; the District of Columbia; the Chesapeake
Bay Commission, a tri-state legislative body; the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, representing the federal government; and
participating advisory groups.

As the largest estuary in the United States and one of the most
productive in the world, the Chesapeake Bay was this nation's first
estuary targeted for restoration and protection. In the late 1970s,
scientific and estuarine research on the Bay pinpointed three areas
requiring immediate attention: nutrient over-enrichment, dwindling
underwater Bay grasses and toxic pollution. Once the initialresearch
was completed, the Bay Program evolved as the means to restore this
exceptionally valuable resource.

Since its inception in 1983, the Bay Program's highest priority has
been the restoration of the Bay's living resources- its finfish,
shellfish, Bay grasses, and other aquatic life and
wildlife. Improvements include fisheries and habitat restoration,
recovery of Bay grasses, nutrient and toxic reductions, and
significant advances in estuarine science.

Considered a national and international model for estuarine research
and restoration programs, the Bay Program is a partnership led by the
Chesapeake Executive Council. The members of the Executive Council are
the governors of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania; the mayor of the
District of Columbia; the administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission. The
Executive Council meets annually to establish the policy direction for
the Bay Program.

In the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement , the Executive Council set a
goal to reduce the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous entering the Bay
by 40% by 2000. Achieving a 40% nutrient reduction will ultimately
improve the oxygen levels in Baywaters and encourage aquatic life to
flourish. In 1992, the Bay Program partners agreed to continue the 40%
reduction goal beyond 2000 as well as to attack nutrients at their
source - upstream in the Bay's tributaries. As a result, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia began developing
tributary strategies to achieve nutrient reduction targets.

On June 28, 2000, the Chesapeake Bay Program partners signed the new
Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, which will guide the next decade of
restoration and protection efforts throughout the Bay watershed. The
agreement commits to protecting and restoring living resources, vital
habitats and water quality of the Bay and its watershed.

Three microwave radiometers measured the apparent radiobrightness of a grassy site at 19, 37, and 85 GHz.  Augmenting these data were measurements of sky radiobrightnesses, terrain and sky  infrared radiometric temperatures, net and global radiation, soil temperatures, soil heat flux, rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.  We also acquired 100 images of the radiometer observation area over the course of the experiment using a video camera and digitization hardware.  We report the experiment log, the microwave radiometer calibration record, known errors in the data, summary and monthly plots of the data, the video images of the site, and snow depth and soil moisture data.  We also describe post-experiment corrections to the microwave radiometer calibrations and radiobrightness data.

Proposal URL:http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=402

The work proposed here is aimed at developing web-based educational tools for pre-university students to let them explore, understand and communicate on polar issues. Specific goals are 1) to increase the knowledge and understanding of polar issues at the pre-university level internationally, 2) to increase the student's interest for natural and social sciences for polar regions, 3) assist polar research by encouraging meaningful data collection and reports by pre-university groups, 4) to encourage and facilitate exchange and communication between the participants. 

The target group are students aged ~13-18 worldwide. The material will cover all six IPY themes and relevant inter-disciplinary topics. The aim is to inspire pupils to seek information about the polar regions and to increase their understanding of polar issues, both for natural and social sciences. The pupils will be provided with links to resources and should work as scientists by combining background knowledge, scientific data, as well as national and international hands-on learning activities (for instance GLOBE protocols). The students will be provided with a web-based report-generating tool to generate scientific reports based on information and material from the scientific findings of IPY work and other polar factual resources. The pupils then assess and conclude on the basis of both the scientist's and their own findings. The IntSchool report-generating tools will be tailored for the specific IPY themes, but also for relevant inter-disciplinary topics covering natural and social sciences, relevant topics important for the local communities of the respective schools and from ongoing IPY projects. The report generator will utilize both existing resources on polar issues and new findings from the IPY projects as well as tools and hands-on educational activities made by various Organisation in different countries. An e-mail based technical help-desk service will be provided for the teachers. Guidelines on how to use these activities for polar issues will be provided and the scientific editors for the solution will be able to communicate with the students and give them feedback on their work. The participating schools will be encouraged to communicate and exchange experience by e-mail correspondence or other Internet communication tools. The IntSchool educational tool will give a key contribution to reaching IPY's overall educational goals, as well as contribute to the outreach and communication goals. 

All support and technical solutions are based on extensive experience in designing and implementing such tools. This overall solution combines the experience, expertise and existing solutions from educational systems, scientific work and web-based solutions, developed and tested in several polar countries over the last decade, into a modern educational tool for IPY. The partners include institutions with extensive scientific knowledge on polar issues, pedagogic institutions with vast experience of hands-on and learning through doing education both in polar communities and internationally, and experts on the development of web-solutions for education. This will ensure:
-Scientific and educational top expertise 
-Years of experience with hands-on education 
-Coverage of both polar regions and all IPY themes 
-Technical detailed experience and knowledge on building and hosting the solution.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Our main objective in this proposed research is to investigate the relative importance and potential interactive effects of iron, light and CO2 levels in structuring algal assemblages and growth rates in the Ross Sea.  We hypothesize that the interaction of these three variables largely determines the bottom-up control on these two dominant Southern Ocean phytoplankton taxa. Grazing and other loss processes will also be important variables in determining the relative dominance of these two taxa; however, the study proposed here will primarily focus on the bottom-up control mechanisms. It is important to understand such environmentally-driven taxonomic shifts in primary production, since they are expected to impact the fixation and export of carbon and nutrients, and the production of DMS, thus potentially providing both positive and negative feedbacks on climate.

Within the context of this proposal, we consider a range of ambient iron, light and pCO2 levels that span those typically observed in the Ross Sea during the growing season.  That is, dissolved iron ranging from ~0.1 nM (“low iron”) to &gt;1 nM (“high iron”) (Fitzwater et al. 2000; Sedwick et al. 2000); mean irradiance (resulting from vertical mixing/self shading) ranging from &lt;10% Io (“low light”) to &gt;40% (“high light”) (Arrigo et al., 1998, 1999), which may be adjusted based on our field observations (see section 6.3.3); and pCO2 ranging (Sweeney et al. 2001) from ~150 ppm (“low CO2”) to the probable higher levels of pCO2 — 750 ppm as a conservative estimate — that are likely to be attained later this century due to anthropogenic perturbation of the global carbon cycle (IPCC, 2001).

From the information currently available from both field observations and experiments, we have formulated the following specific hypotheses regarding the interactive role of iron, light and CO2 in regulating algal composition in the Ross Sea.  Principally, we propose that diatoms bloom in the southern Ross Sea only under optimum conditions of high iron, light and pCO2; colonial Phaeocystis dominate under conditions of high iron with either (or both) low light or low pCO2; and solitary Phaeocystis are predominant under conditions of low iron with either (or both) low light or low pCO2.  Two cruises are planned to investigate the interactions between the primary productivity of the Ross Sea and pCO2, iron and other trace elements.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=300

The theme of this project is to establish comprehensive, arctic-wide, locally driven monitoring programmes for biodiversity of Arctic char through two linked components: 1) Community-based monitoring, and 2) Research-based Monitoring. Such work will allow for both local indigenous peoples and researchers to document changes in the biodiversity of char populations and their local ecosystems and to link their findings into a comprehensive view of global change as it affects this key Arctic fishery resource. During the IPY period (2006-2008) this activity will: a) establish a network and outreach among northern communities, char researchers, conservation groups, and other IPY projects; b) research and/or summarise present local and global biodiversity in chars; c) develop appropriate monitoring protocols for char status and diversity; and, d) establish relevant local and global monitoring/research sites and teams in as many Arctic countries as possible. Using these IPY short-term products as the background, the long-term goals are to establish long-term funding for the Network, extend it to un- or under-represented areas, and establish legacy databases and trained individuals, assessment schedules, and monitoring approaches and research topics suitable for long-term monitoring and research. This activity is fundamental to the conservation and sustainability of this pivotal arctic aquatic resource and will contribute to this by documenting present status and impacts on this fish and its Arctic ecosystems, project future status, and provide the foundation for adaptation strategies designed to meet challenges of change in the Arctic.
Further, this activity is a direct response fulfilling a specific aim and initiative of the Arctic Council as follows. In its acceptance of the findings and projections from the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA), the Arctic Council directed two of its working groups, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) and Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) to examine the ACIA findings and develop follow-on programmes and activities, both individually and jointly, to address key projections for the future of the Arctic. A primary response of the CAFF working group was the implementation of the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme (CBMP, IPY133) formally released in September, 2005 (http://www.caff.is). The CBMP calls for the development of a number of specific networks designed to monitor the status and change of key Arctic organisms of primary importance to the integrity of Arctic ecosystems and the culture and livelihood of indigenous peoples. Arctic char was specifically designated by the CBMP as a target species for monitoring the general health and biodiversity of Arctic aquatic ecosystems. Results and activities from this char network will contribute directly to CBMP work; furthermore, additional networks (e.g., Freshwater Biodiversity, IPY202) and specific research endeavours (e.g., Arctic char thermal habitat use; IPY 144) developed through IPY stimulus are directly linked to this IPY proposal (i.e., lead on this project, J. Reist, is a member of the CBMP, and is a co-lead (144) or named participant (202) of other projects). A component of this project is also linked to the IPY Youth project (IPY168). This proposed network is also tightly linked to established existing char researchers (i.e. International Society of Arctic char Fanatics, ISACF IPY project co-lead, J. Hammar, is principal of ISACF and J. Reist is a long-time member).
Chars are a group of closely related fish species that collectively form a key renewable resource for northern peoples from the sub-Arctic through to the northernmost freshwaters of all Arctic nations. Chars exhibit great biodiversity both within and among locations (e.g., ecological forms, life history types, etc.). These forms may act as distinct ecological "species" in Arctic systems thus contribute to ecosystem stability and resilience. Chars also may occupy and migrate among many habitats during their life history, thus are key components of, and linking entities between, freshwater (both lakes and rivers), estuarine, and near-shore ecosystems. Chars are usually apex predators within their ecosystems thus they integrate lower-level ecosystem impacts. Chars are highly responsive to many anthropogenic impacts and are pivotal integrators of both short-term (e.g., exploitation, contaminants, habitat change, industrial development) and long-term (e.g., climate variability and change) direct effects both on themselves and indirect effects on their ecosystems. Chars are also widely fished supporting local food, commercial and sport fisheries as well as northern aquaculture endeavours. Thus, chars are of primary interest to northern peoples as a key resource, hence interest and involvement of community-based monitoring is high. Accordingly, chars are useful both as monitors of ecosystem change and for understanding responses of northern resources and ecosystems to anthropogenic drivers at many temporal and spatial levels. This network will provide the basis for integrating these activities throughout the Arctic thereby establishing a lasting legacy for a key northern renewable resource.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Pantanal Mato Grossense National Park is part of the largest permanent freshwater wetland in the western hemisphere. It includes some of the largest and most spectacular concentrations of Wildlife in the Neotropics, made possible by the different types of environment and their transition areas. In this rich environment, there are several endangered species, among them the wild cat, the agouara, the swamp deer, the otter and the giant river otter of Brazil. One also finds the tiger heron (Tigrisoma fasciatum) and the giant armadillo (Priodontes giganteus). The number of such species makes this a region of great importance for the perpetuation of many of these species.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">NSF Award 0440769, Explorers Cove, Antarctica</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Explorers Cove, Antarctica, is currently the only place on Earth where biologists can use scuba to directly access a &amp;deep-sea-like&amp; ecosystem and collect basal allogromiids in bulk; it is therefore a site of profound scientific interest. Explorers Cove forams, which may normally have bathymetric ranges to &gt;3,000 m, are ideal for field and laboratory experimentation, and serve as useful model systems for studying the ecology and evolution of deep-sea assemblages. 

Just as a firm understanding of the protists is vital to developing a clear picture of early eukaryotic evolution, the key to the origin of Foraminifera lies in the study of the early branching allogromiids. An improved understanding of the relationships between early forams through multigene based molecular phylogenies is a goal of this project. Additionally, a more careful study of the &amp;crown allogromiids&amp; will illuminate the evolutionary steps that lead to the rotaliids, which dominate many shallow-water temperate environments and pelagic foram assemblages.

Extant protists represent the modern products of ancient predatory (phagotrophic) prokaryotes. Protists are well known as consumers of microbiota, but the consumption of metazoans by protists is not widely appreciated. As a result, the consequences of ancient predatory protists are rarely considered a major factor in the diversification of animals during the late Proterozoic/early Cambrian. This project will test hypothesis that predation on metazoans is widespread among basal forams, and if supported by analyses of the new protein-coding sequence data, then the role of these protists in Neoproterozoic ecosystems will need to be reevaluated.

The objectives of the research are to: test the validity of the foram phylogenetic hypotheses currently based solely on single gene sequence data; examine the ultrastructure of representative members of allogromiid clades; explore the origin of polar forams using the new molecular phylogenetic and structural data; further examine the trophic strategies of allogromiids; and to determine if carnivory is a fundamental nutritional mode for basal forams, or a special derived character.

These instruments cover the spectrum from UV to submillimeter, and are intended to fully characterize potential astronomical sites at a variety of locations on the high Antarctic plateau. The CARA AASTO project enjoys strong collaboration with the University of New South Wales and the Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia.

It is currently operational at South Pole station, and will later be deployed to remote, uninhabited sites on the high Antarctic plateau. It has a suite of astronomical site-testing instruments, so that potential observatory sites can be fully characterized over a wide range of wavelengths.

In addition to the astronomical site-testing data, the AASTO also collects weather data such as temperature, wind speed and direction, and atmospheric pressure.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Seasonal Response of the Equatorial Atlantic</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In situ wind measurements collected as part of the Programme Français Océan et Climat dans l&amp;#039;Atlantique Equatorial (FOCAL)/Seasonal Response of the Equatorial Atlantic (SEQUAL) experiment (1983-1984) in the western and eastern parts of the equatorial Atlantic basin are described. They were obtained from meteorological stations placed Saint Peter Peter and Saint Paul Rocks (SPP) (1°N, 29°W) and at the top of a surface buoy moored in the Gulf of Guinea (0°N, 4°W). From the wind observations the wind stress was inferred, and results are compared with climatology. The wind stress time series show the abrupt increase of the winds during the spring that, at SPP, reaches a value as high as 0.35 dyn/cm2 in 2 weeks for both observed years. The 11-day running mean time series shows that the onset of the zonal component of the wind stress occurs at SPP on April 10, 1983, and on May 17, 1984, and in the Gulf of Guinea (GG) on April 5, 1983, and April 10, 1984. The monthly mean observations show an interannual variability both in the time of the onset and in the strength of the trade winds. At SPP and GG the total wind stress increases 1 month earlier than climatology in 1983 but at the same time as climatology in 1984. At SPP the zonal component of the wind stress also intensifies 1 month earlier than climatology in 1983 but 1 month later in 1984. The equatorial temperature records at 28°W and 4°W show that the depth of the 20°C isotherm, on a seasonal time scale, decreases during the relaxation period of the trade winds (boreal winter). In 1983-1984 this occurred in December 1983 at 28°W and in March 1984 at 4°W. After the onset of the local trade winds, the thermocline continues to move upward during 1 month at 28°W and during 3 months at 4°W thereafter, the thermocline deepens at both locations. At the surface, the temperature decreases when the trade winds intensify and remains low as long as the trade winds are blowing. The seasonal variations of the temperature both at the surface and below the surface at 28°W and 4°W are interpreted in the light of the results of a nonlinear multilevel model in the cases of a sudden increase and a sudden relaxation of the trade winds.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The MAPS experiment measures the global distribution of carbon
monoxide (CO) in the free troposphere. Because of MAPS' previous
flights on board the Space Shuttle, Earth system scientists now know
that carbon monoxide concentrations in the troposphere are highly
variable around the planet, and that widespread burning in the South
American Amazon region and the African savannas are major global
sources of carbon monoxide in the troposphere.

      MAPS Hardware:

MAPS consists of an electro-optical sensor, an electronics module, a
digital tape dsata record, and an aerial camera. The 92 kg MAPS
package is 90 cm long, 76 cm wide, and 58 cm high. The hardware
is coupled to a cold plate and mounted on the Multi-Purpose
Experiment Support Structure (MPESS) which is installed at the
forward end of the cargo bay.  The electro-optical sensor
incorporates two gas cells, one containing 350 hPa of CO and
another containing 149 hPa of N2O; their corresponding
detectors; a direct radiation detector; and external balance and
gain check system; and an internal balance system.

The electronics module of MAPS consists of the signal processors, the
balance system controls, and the circuitry required to operate the
system. The space-qualified Lockheed Mark V tape recorder records the
experiment data at an average rate of 43 bits per second. The Flight
Research 35-mm aerial camera, equipped with a light sensor,
photographs the groundtrack during sunlit portions of the orbit.

      MAPS Operations:

When the Space Shuttle attains Earth-viewing position, the MAPS
instrument pallet (shown in the lower right hand corner) power
is supplied and the instrument is commanded on. After a
30-minute warmup, the instrument executes a balance cycle and
gain check before it begins to take data. MAPS continues to
operate throughout the Earth- observing period. Balance and gain
check recur at 12-hour intervals or upon command from the
Earth-based experiment team.  The three instrument signals (two
difference channel signals and one direct radiometer signal) and
various "housekeeping" signals are digitized, formatted, and
stored on the experiment's tape recorder. These signals are also
telemetered to the ground via the Space Shuttle telemetry
system. When the Payload Operations Control Center receives the
telemetered signals, the MAPS operations team evaluates the
instrument operation and processes the signals to provide "quick
look" carbon monoxide mixing ratios along the shuttle ground
track.

The aerial camera mounted next to the MAPS electro-optical head
provides information on cloud cover and terrain over which the data
are gathered. Operation of the camera and tape recorder can be
inhibited during periods when the Shuttle is not in proper
Earth-viewing attitude.

MAPS Investigators:

The MAPS experiment is conducted by a team led by Principal
Investigator Henry G. Reichle, Jr. of NASA's Langley Research
Center. The MAPS science team, which advises the experiment team and
assists in evaluation of MAPS data, consists of V. Connors, NASA
Langley Research Center; W. Hesketh, Space Tec Ventures;
P. Kasibhatla, Georgia Institute of Technology; V. Kirchoff, Instituto
Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), Brazil; J. Logan, Harvard
University; R. Newell, Massachusetts Institute of Technology;
R. Nicholls, York University, Canada; L. Peters, University of
Kentucky; W. Seiler, Fraunhofer-Institut Fur Atmospharische
Umweltforschung, Germany; H. Wallio, NASA Langley Research Center.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">[Source: Ice Edge Programme, http://www.iceedge.no/cleopatra/project-summary ]

This project will investigate how increased light intensities, due to reduced ice concentrations and ice extent, affect timing, quantity and quality of primary and secondary production in the Arctic marginal ice zone (MIZ).The MIZ is the key productive area of Arctic shelf seas. The ongoing warming of Arctic regions will lead to a northward retreat of the MIZ, and to an earlier opening of huge areas in spring. This may result in a temporal mismatch between the phytoplankton spring bloom and zooplankton reproduction. Less ice will also reduce the ice algae production that may be an important food source for spawning zooplankton prior to the phytoplankton spring bloom. Quantity and quality of primary production in seasonally ice-covered seas is primarily regulated by light and nutrients. Excess light, however, is potentially detrimental for algae and can reduce algal food quality. A decrease in the relative amount of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in algae due to excess light may affect the reproductive success and growth of zooplankton, and thereby the transport of energy to higher trophic levels, such as fish, birds, and mammals. We will carry out an extensive field campaign in spring, land based in the high Arctic fjord Rijpfjorden (Nordaustlandet, Svalbard), to follow the development in biomass and food quality of ice algae, phytoplankton and secondary production before, under and after ice break up. The copepod Calanus glacialis, the key herbivore in Arctic shelf seas will be used as target species for secondary production. The role of PUFAs for the reproductive success of Calanus, as well as the algal potential for acclimation to high and shifting light intensities will be studied in controlled laboratory experiments in Ny Ålesund (Marine Laboratory) and Longyearbyen (UNIS). Ultimately, this study aims to predict food web effects of reduced ice concentrations and ice cover in Arctic shelf seas, such as the Barents Sea.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">            The GPCC is hosted and funded by Deutscher Wetterdienst DWD
            (German Weather Service) as a German contribution to the World
            Climate Research Programme. The centre was established in 1988
            on request of WMO as a component of the international Global
            Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and has various
            international co-operations.
      
            The task of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP)
            is to provide the climate research community with gridded
            datasets of monthly precipitation totals based on observational
            data. The specific GPCC functions are defined by the
            'Implementation and Data Management Plan for the Global
            Precipitation Climatology Project' (WCRP 1990, WMO/TD-No. 367)
            and comprise:
      
      1. Acquisition, collection, and organized storage of precipitation
         data from surface-based networks;
      
      2. Quality-control and assessment of the collected resp. used data,
         correction of errors;
      
      3. Calculation of gridded area-mean monthly precipitation for the
         earth's landsurface;
      
      4. Error assessment for the precipitation totals on the individual
         gridcell;
      
      5. Combination of the gridded monthly precipitation data from
         surface-based and satellite observations (this item is performed
         jointly by all GPCP components).
      
            First steps are taken to derive daily precipitation totals based
            on GTS - SYNOP data.
      
            New GPCC functions have been defined in the framework of the
            Arctic Climate System Study (ACSYS):
      
            1. Development of an Arctic Precipitation Data Archive (APDA)
               including daily precipitation and snow depth data;
      
            2. Calculation of area-mean precipitation series for Arctic river
               basins.
      
            GPCC also performs intercomparison studies for gridded
            precipitation datasets from different sources (surface or
            satellite based observations, model results, climatologies from
            various authors).  Furthermore, the GPCC applies its analysis
            system for special studies, e.g on the Oder River floading in
            July 1997 or the El-Nino precipitation anomalies in winter
            1997/1998.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The JASON-2 project is a response to the international demand for programmes to study and observe oceans and the climate, through a worldwide ocean observation system. It is a continuation to the TOPEX/POSEIDON and JASON-1 altimetry missions developed by CNES and NASA. Altimetry,  i.e. the precise measurement of ocean surface topography, has indeed become since 1992 (launch  of TOPEX/POSEIDON) an essential tool for the study of oceans on a global scale.

JASON-2 is part of cooperation between CNES, EUMETSAT, NASA and NOAA. Space and 
ground segments of the Jason-2 mission strongly inherit from the JASON-1 mission.

Onboard the JASON-2 satellite, which uses a PROTEUS platform, the payload is composed 
of a Poseidon-3 radar altimeter supplied by CNES, an Advanced Microwave Radiometer (AMR) 
supplied by NASA/JPL, and a triple system for precise orbit determination: the DORIS instrument
 (CNES), GPS receiver and a Laser Retroflector Array (LRA) (NASA). Three further onboard 
instruments (T2L2, LPT, CARMEN-2) will also be included. 

In order to ensure continuity and optimal inter-calibration of observations over the long term, 
JASON-2 will fly the same orbit as JASON-1 and TOPEX/POSEIDON. Moreover, data processing 
will be integrated into the CNES ground segment "SALP" (altimetry and precise positioning 
system), which already operates the altimetry missions TOPEX/POSEIDON, JASON-1, 
ENVISAT, GFO, whose data is distributed on the AVISO website.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Abstract:


 The Pacific Exploratory Mission - Tropics B (PEM-Tropics B) was
 conducted by the NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) over
 the tropical Pacific Ocean in March-April 1999. It used two
 NASA aircraft, a DC-8 and a P-3B. Its central objective was to
 improve knowledge of the factors controlling ozone, OH,
 aerosols, and related species over the vast and remote region
 defined by the tropical Pacific. Both aircraft were equipped
 with extensive instrumentation for measuring numerous chemical
 compounds and gases. The geographical coverage ranged from 38N
 to 36S in latitude and 148W to 76E in longitude. Major
 deployment sites included Hilo, Hawaii; Christmas Island;
 Tahiti; Fiji; and Easter Island. PEM-Tropics B was a sequel to
 PEM-Tropics A, conducted in September-October 1996. The latter
 field study encountered considerable biomass burning indluence
 over the South Pacific associated with the dry season in the
 southern tropics. PEM-Tropics B, conducted in the wet season of
 the so!  uthern tropics, observed an exceedingly clean
 atmosphere over the South Pacific but a variety of pollution
 influences over the tropical North Pacific, including
 long-range transport from industrial sources in Eurasia and
 North America as well as from seasonal biomass burning in
 Southeast Asia. Photochemical ozone loss over both the North
 and the South Pacific exceeded local photochemical production
 by about a factor of two, implying the need for a major inflow
 term to balance the tropospheric budget over the
 region. Dedicated flights investigated the sharp air mass
 transitions at the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and at
 the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). Extensive OH
 observations, many involving diurnal profiles at several
 different altitudes, permitted the first large-scale
 comparisons with photochemical model predictions. High
 concentrations of oxygenated organics were observed
 ubiquitously in the tropical Pacific atmosphere and may have
 important implicat!  ions for global HOx and NOx
 budgets. Extensive equatorial measurements of DSMS and OH, some
 of which were recorded in coincidence with exceptionally high
 levels of the oxidation product DMSO, suggest that important
 aspects of marine sulfur chemistry are also still poorly
 understood.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Columbia River Estuary Data Development Program</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Columbia River Estuary Data Development Program (CREDDP) has two purposes:
to increase understanding of the ecology of the Columbia River Estuary and to
provide information useful in making land and water use decisions.  The program
was initiated by local governments and citizens who saw a need for a better
information base for use in managing natural resources and in planning for
development.  In response to these concerns, the Governors of Oregon and
Washington requested in 1974 that the Pacific Northwest River Basins Commission
(PNRBC) undertake an interdisciplinary ecological study of the estuary.  At
approximately the same time, local governments and port districts formed the
Columbia River Estuary Study Taskforce (CREST) to develop a regional management
plan for the estuary.
CREDDP was designed to meet the needs of those groups who were expected to be
the principal users of the information being developed.  One group consisted of
government officials and others involved in planning.  The other group was
researchers and educators.  The ecological research in CREDDP focuses on the
linkages among different elements in the food web and the influence on that web
of such physical processes as currents, sediment transport, and salinity
intrusion.
Research was divided into thirteen projects, called work units.  Three work
units, Emergent Plant Primary Production, Benthic Primary Production, and Water
Column Primary Production, dealt with the plant life which, through
photosynthesis and uptake of chemical nutrients, forms the base of the esturine
food web.  The goals of these work units were to describe and map the
productivity and biomass patterns of the estuary's primary producers and to
describe the relationship of physical factors to primary producers and their
productivity levels.
The higher trophic levels in the estuarine food web were the focus of seven
CREDDP work units: Zooplankton and Larval Fish, Benthic Infauna, Epibenthic
Organisms, Fish, Avifauna, Wildlife, and Marine Mammals.  The goals of these
work units were to describe and map the abundance patterns of the invertebrate
and vertebrate species and to describe these species' relationships to relevant
physical factors.
The other three work units, Sedimentation and Shoaling, Currents, and
Simulation, dealt with physical processes.  The work unit goals were to
characterize and map bottom sediment distribution, to characterize sediment
transport, and to determine the cause of bathymetric change, and to determine
and model circulation patterns, vertical mixing and salinity patterns.
Final reports on all these thirteen work units have been published.  In
addition, these results are integrated in a comprehensive synthesis entitled
THE DYNAMICS OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER ESTURINE ECOSYSTEM, the purpose of which is
to develop and description of the estuary at the ecosystem level of
organization.

Beluga whales make an ideal indicator species for Arctic climate change, given their circumpolar distribution and close association with ice formation and decay. This project will instrument 100 belugas per year over three years with satellite transmitters and, in some locations, oceanographic data loggers, to obtain a synoptic snapshot of the pattern and timing of beluga movements in relation to sea ice, surface temperature, primary productivity, bathymetry, as well as temperature and salinity at depth through beluga dive profiles. This baseline data will be invaluable information against which to make comparisons through time as the Arctic undergoes climate change. 
By serving as autonomous underwater samplers, belugas will collect oceanographic data at depth in regions of particular interest, such as polynyas, during winter months when ship-based collection of such data would be difficult, dangerous, or impossible. Such data can assist oceanographers with modeling ocean temperatures, salinity, currents, heat exchange, formation of deep and intermediate waters.and rates of change that may aid in our understanding patterns relating to climate change. 
Belugas will be tagged across their range in Svalbard, Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland, which will help delineate stock structure, particularly where ranges overlap but beluga migration patterns are distinct. Little is currently known about beluga stocks in Russia, so this study will make an important contribution in that area. Local arctic peoples and young scientists in training in each region will participate in the fieldwork, educational outreach, and or, data analysis. Tissue samples, measurements, and other data will be collected from each tagged beluga to aid in auxiliary studies. Finally, establishment of a real-time web-based display of beluga movements will be a window for the public through which to view this fascinating research. There will also be an educational DVD, magazine, film and aquarium exhibits produced to interpret this important science.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">AQUARIUS SAC-D</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Mission Overview
 The joint U.S./Argentinian Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas (SAC)-D mission will map the salinity—the concentration of dissolved salt—at the ocean surface, information critical to improving our understanding of two major components of Earth's climate system: the water cycle and ocean circulation. By measuring ocean salinity from space, Aquarius will provide new insights into how the massive natural exchange of freshwater between the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice influences ocean circulation, weather and climate.

Because ocean surface salinity varies from place to place and over time, scientists can use it to trace the ocean's role in Earth's water cycle. For example, more than 85 percent of global evaporation and more than 75 percent of global precipitation occur over the ocean. By measuring changes in ocean surface salinity caused by these processes, as well as by ice melting and river runoff, Aquarius/SAC-D will provide important new information about how Earth's freshwater moves between the ocean and atmosphere and around the globe.

Knowing ocean surface salinity can also help scientists track ocean currents and better understand ocean circulation. Salinity, together with temperature, determines how dense and buoyant seawater is. This, in turn, drives how ocean waters are layered and mixed and the formation of water masses. Salinity also has a major effect on ocean circulation, including the flow of currents that move heat from the tropics to the poles.

Aquarius/SAC-D will provide essential ocean surface salinity data needed to link the water cycle and ocean circulation—two major components of the climate system. This information, in turn, will help scientists improve the accuracy of computer climate models.

Global ocean salinity has been an area of much scientific uncertainty. Past measurements of salinity have been limited mostly to summertime observations in shipping lanes. Recently, a European mission has begun making ocean surface salinity measurements. With the launch of Aquarius/SAC-D, scientists will collect more data in the mission's first few months than had been amassed by ships and in-water sensors during the previous 125 years.

Scheduled for launch no earlier than June 2011, Aquarius/SAC-D is designed to measure ocean surface salinity for at least three years, repeating its global pattern every seven days. During its lifetime, the mission will provide monthly maps of global changes in ocean surface salinity with a resolution of 150 kilometers (93 miles), showing how salinity changes from month-to-month, season-to-season and year-to-year. The spacecraft will fly in a sun-synchronous orbit 657 kilometers (408 miles) above Earth's surface.

NASA's Aquarius is the primary instrument on the SAC-D spacecraft. It consists of three passive microwave radiometers to detect the surface emission that is used to obtain salinity and an active scatterometer to measure the ocean waves that affect the precision of the salinity measurement. While salinity levels in the open ocean generally range from 32 to 37 practical salinity units, or psu (roughly equivalent to parts per thousand), the Aquarius sensor will be able to detect changes in salinity as small as 0.2 psu. This is equivalent to about a "pinch" (i.e., 1/8 of a teaspoon) of salt in one gallon of water.

Aquarius/SAC-D is a collaboration between NASA and Argentina's space agency, Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), with participation from Brazil, Canada, France and Italy. The Aquarius instrument was jointly built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. JPL will manage Aquarius through the mission's commissioning phase and will archive mission data. Goddard will manage the mission's operations phase and process Aquarius science data. NASA's Launch Services Program at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida is managing the launch. CONAE is providing the SAC-D spacecraft, an optical camera, a thermal camera in collaboration with Canada, a microwave radiometer, sensors developed by various Argentine institutions, and the mission operations center in Argentina. France and Italy are also contributing instruments.

Snow and ice are pervasive elements of high latitude
environmental systems and have an active role in the global
environment. The glaciology program is concerned with the study
of the history and dynamics of all naturally occurring forms of
snow and ice, including floating ice, seasonal snow, glaciers,
and continental and marine ice sheets. Program emphases include
paleoenvironments from ice cores, ice dynamics, numerical
modeling, glacial geology, and remote sensing of ice
sheets. Some specific objectives include the correlation of
climatic fluctuations evident in Antarctic ice cores with data
from arctic and lower-latitude ice cores, the integration of the
ice record with the terrestrial and marine records, the
investigation of the physics of fast glacier flow with emphasis
on processes at glacier beds, the investigation of ice-shelf
stability and the identification and quantification of the
feedback between ice dynamics and climate change.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) Hydrology Experiment took
place in the subhumid environment in Oklahoma over a one-month
period of June 18 - July 17, 1997. The objectives are:

1. To examine the estimation of surface soil moisture
   and temperature using remote sensing at a hierarchy of
   scales

2. To examine the feasibility of estimating vertical
   profiles of soil moisture and temperature by combining in
   situ data, remote sensing measurements at the surface,
   and modeling techniques

3. To evaluate the influence of soil moisture on the local
   surface energy budget and the influence of mesoscale
   variability in the surface energy budget on the
   development of convective boundary layer

The SGP97 Hydrology Experiment as it has developed is a
collaboration by a team of interested scientists largely based on
existing sponsored scientific investigations and research projects.
Cooperation and contributions by many have resulted in a
comprehensive opportunity for multidisciplinary research. Version 1 of
the SGP97 data, available for general research use, is expected in
September 1998.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
 The World Water and Climate Atlas (WWCA)was developed jointly by
 the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) and the
 Utah Climate Center at Utah State University. It aims at
 providing easily accessible climatic information necessary for
 the planning, design, operation, and management of water
 resources and irrigated agricultural systems.

 The atlas uses climatic data from over 56,000 stations
 world-wide with coverage from 1961 through 1990 and includes
 monthly and/or annual averages for evapo-transpiration, daily
 temperatures, precipitation, and the probability distributions
 of rainfall frequency and amount. The climatic factors are
 mapped at a 2.5 km resolution using state-of-the-art spatial
 interpolation techniques incorporating elevation modelling. The
 data sets contain best available data from international and
 local sources. The quality of the data varies, and has been
 partly improved by removing stations responsible for outlying
 values not explained by known effects. (Since there are many
 locations with sparse data, short periods of record, and
 spatially highly variable climate, it is still strongly
 recommended that the atlas be used together with local
 information.) Additional parameters included in the atlas are
 the moisture availability index that can be used to identify
 areas of rain-fed agricultura!  l potential and to evaluate
 needs for irrigation and drainage, and the net
 evapo-transpiration which is an indication of the required
 depth of irrigation.


 Use of the atlas:

 1. estimation of synthetic virgin stream-flow;
 2. evaluation of flow development potential;
 3. exploration of the impact of climate change on irrigated areas;
 4. salinisation studies.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> From January 30 to March 29 2001, a team of 25 scientists, including Charlie McClennen and Amy Leventer (Chief Scientist), and Colgate undergraduate geology majors Natalie McLenaghan, Meredith Metcalf, and Caroline Olson, explored the East Antarctic Margin on cruise NBP0101 of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer. The Palmer is one of two icebreakers leased by the National Science Foundation and is dedicated almost entirely to conducting scientific research in the Southern Ocean. This 58-day cruise left from Hobart Tasmania and returned to port in Capetown South Africa, after transiting nearly a quarter of the way around the perimeter of Antarctica. Along the way, nearly a quarter mile of sediment core was recovered from seven deep shelf basins, with the goal of developing a record of climate and oceanographic change during the Quaternary. Although the pace of recent climate change appears to be more rapid and of a larger scale in Antarctica compared to other areas of the globe, the factors forcing climate change in Antarctica are not well understood, due to the relative inaccessibility of the southernmost continent and the inhospitable working conditions. In order to address this scarcity of samples, particularly from the eastern side of the continent, we devoted our two months of ship time to acquiring as much data as possible. Most of the sediment core material was recovered with the "Jumbo Piston Corer," a 90-foot long, 5" diameter, assembly of steel barrels, plastic core liner, and lead weights. Core sites were selected based on a combination of sub-bottom profiling and seafloor bathymetric mapping of well stratified and undisturbed acoustic reflectors. Back in the lab, our group has been responsible for two lines of investigation. First, we develop paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on microscopic analysis of diatoms, single celled algae with a hard silica skeleton that serves as a permanent record of past climate. Second, we work with the sea floor maps to decipher the geologic processes that have shaped the seabed. Natalie, Caroline and Meredith worked with both Charlie and Amy as well as with our colleagues from other institutions, on senior projects based on the data collected during the cruise. Their contribution to the success of this cruise has been invaluable. Geology undergrads will continue the detailed analysis for the next few years as we extract the clearest indicators of Antarctic margin climate change from the core samples.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=142
Microalgae - prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae play a key role in Arctic and Antarctic ecology as primary producers. They can cope with extreme temperatures, varying light intensities, as well as low availability of essential nutrients and other resources. Microalgae constitute a potential resource useful in biotechnological applications and they have an important advantage over many other organisms as they can be expediently cultured for the production and processing of desirable compounds. Culturing of microalgae and their maintenance in a culture collection as a stable renewable resource is a huge advantage in the development of their value to biotechnology. The promising application, with a possible turn-up both for the public health and for the safeguard of the ambient, is definitely the utilization of microalgae as a source of bioactive substances. Recently, much effort has been expended on the search for new compounds of therapeutic potential, demonstrating that microalgae of all classes possess antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. There is also a number of different modes in which microalgae are utilised in aquaculture: a) as feed to supply basic nutrients; b) as a source of pigments to improve the colour of fish; c) for other biological purposes. Some prospects for new chemicals have been reported in recent years, the most prominent of which are carotenoids of nutritional and medical value, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), polysaccharides, peptides and radical scavengers. 
Even though, the cultivation scale-up of microalgae in polar regions seem to be difficult due to the harsh climatic conditions, on the basis of preliminary experiments, we propose an innovative step to develop microalgal photobioreactors for extreme environmental conditions, which could potentially help to develop local industry and at the same time provide a viable means of treating domestic wastewaters generated by local communities. Various types of photobioreactors (both closed and semi-closed systems) are to be constructed and tested in various parts of the Arctic Region. This might lay the basis of sustainable biotechnology to cultivate local native strains, which offer a rich source of food additives and other bioactive substances. It is proposed that the experiments will be carried out at the Canadian base of Ellesmere Island and at the Italian base of Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. It is expected that in the future, cultivation studies will be extended to Antarctic Region at the Italian (Mario Zucchelli Station), Czech (James Ross Island) and Indian (Schirmacher Oases) bases. 
Although the programme seems to be very ambitious and difficult to realize, once the prototypes of the photobioreactors are experimented in both bipolar regions, the feasibility of growing the algae and cyanobacteria for food and bio-products could become in a reality. The project will develop innovative field mass culture units, which aims to optimize light energy utilization and minimize environmental impact, potentially integrating with existing polar infrastructure and associated nutrient and energy sources. Moreover, it will establish or add to valuable bio-geographical, taxonomic, physiological, biochemical and genetic parameters for polar micro-algae. Microalgae are also key resources to wastewater treatment systems, where they remove nutrients and contaminants. For exemple, this process has been already applied to bioremediate mining sites in Artic Canada. It may be possible, therefore, to use infrastructure and wastewater from polar town sites and industrial operations, and integrate photobioreactors into future urban/industrial development. A web site will be created, with links to all academic, university and industrial partners raising individual establishment profiles and highlight ecological benefits. 
The team will involve collaboration among Canada, Italy, Czech Republic, India and potentially other interested nations. In principle this project is continuation of existing research studies conducted recently and in the past (both in Arctic and Antarctic) by different members of the team. The exploitation of polar based bio-active metabolites is a new and innovative proposal, as is the biotechnology of outdoor studies with polar phototrophic strains.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The FIRE Cirrus Intensive Field Observations-II (IFO-II) was conducted
November 13 - December 3, 1991, in southeastern Kansas. The goal of
Cirrus IFO-II was to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of mid-continent cirrus clouds and advected sub-tropical
cirrus clouds. The Cirrus IFO-II combined coordinated satellite,
airborne, and surface-based observations with modeling activities to
study the roles and interactions of processes acting over telescoping
scales ranging from the microscale to the large-scale and on
characterizing the physical, radiative, and optical properties of
cirrus clouds (E7IRE Cirrus Intensive Field Observations-II:
Operations Plan, 1991). The data has been instrumental in developing
parameterizations relating cloud-scale processes to climate-scale
variables, and in improving our understanding and utilization of ISCCP
data products.

SCENTIFIC OBJECTIVES:

The key science objectives for the Cirrus IFO-II field experiment were to:

Incorporate FIRE-I data and -II data into models of varying scale and
complexity for the purpose of developing and testing CIRRUS
parameterizations and assessing capabilities to reliably simulate
cirrus development on short and long time scales.  Characterize the
physical, thermodynamical, and dynamical development of cirrus clouds
on the synoptic scale, the mesoscale, the convective/turbulent scale,
and the microscale.  Characterize relationships among various cirrus
cloud optical properties, including, cloud optical depths in the
visible, near infrared, and infrared, cloud scattering phase
functions, and cloud single-scattering albedos; and the corresponding
cloud physical properties, including, particle size, number density,
phase, and habit, and cloud height, temperature, and thickness.
Explicitly quantify the capabilities and limitations of methods to
derive physical and optical cirrus cloud properties from satellite
observations, especially ISCCP, and future techniques for producing
global cloud climatologies in the EOS era.  Quantify the impact of
cirrus clouds on the surface, atmosphere, and top-of- atmosphere
radiation budgets.  Improve the capability to utilize surface-based
active and passive remote sensing observations for quantitative
studies of cirrus clouds.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Overview of the Experiment:

DUNDEE was carried out in the vicinity of Darwin, Northern Territory,
Australia during the wet seasons of November 1988 through February
1989, and November 1989 through February 1990. The general goal of
DUNDEE was to investigate the dynamical and electrical properties of
tropical mesoscale convective systems and isolated deep convective
storms. The observational network consisted of two C-band Doppler
radars (MIT and TOGA), a 50 MHz vertically pointing wind profiler,
mesonet stations, upper air sounding stations, and cloud electricity
instrumentation.

DUNDEE was a collaborative effort between Colorado State University
(S.A. Rutledge), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(E. Williams), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and
the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre (T. Keenan).

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics, IGBP</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) is one of the core projects of the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and was initiated by SCOR
and the IOC of UNESCO in 1991, to understand how global change will affect the
abundance, diversity and productivity of marine populations comprising a major
component of oceanic ecosystems.

The aim of GLOBEC is to advance our understanding of the structure and
functioning of the global ocean ecosystem, its major subsystems, and its
response to physical forcing so that a capability can be developed to forecast
the responses of the marine ecosystem to global change.

GLOBEC considers global change in the broad sense, encompassing the gradual
processes of climate change and its impacts on marine systems, as well as those
shorter-term changes resulting from anthropogenic pressures, such as population
growth in coastal areas, increased pollution, overfishing, changing fishing
practices and changing human use of the seas.

GLOBEC has four primary objectives:

1) To better understand how multiscale physical environmental processes force
large-scale changes in marine ecosystems.
2) To determine the relationships between structure and dynamics in a variety
of oceanic systems which typify significant components of the global ocean
ecosystem, with emphasis on trophodynamic pathways, their variability and the
role of nutrition quality in the food web.
3) To determine the impacts of global change on stock dynamics using coupled
physical, biological and chemical models linked to appropriate observation
systems and to develop the capability to predict future impacts.
4) To determine how changing marine ecosystems will affect the global earth
system by identifying and quantifying feedback mechanisms.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) role in
the NASA's Earth Observation (EOS) program is to provide global,
long-term measurements of key components of the Earth's
atmosphere. The most important of these are the vertical distribution
of aerosols and ozone from the upper troposphere through the
stratosphere.

In addition, SAGE III also provides unique measurements of temperature
in the stratosphere and mesosphere and profiles of trace gases such as
water vapor and nitrogen dioxide that play significant roles in
atmospheric radiative and chemical processes.

The SAGE III Science Team functions in a dual role where they ensure
the data quality and interpret the SAGE III data in the broader
context of global change.

The SAGE III instrument is a grating spectrometer that measures
ultraviolet/visible energy. It relies upon the flight-proven designs
used in the Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM I) and SAGE I and
II instruments.

The SAGE III instrument was developed and managed by NASA Langley
Research Center and was built by Ball Aerospace in Boulder, CO. Three
copies were produced. One instrument is mounted on the Meteor-3M
spacecraft and a second will be place in orbit on the International
Space Station in 2005.  SAGE III on the Meteor-3M is a joint mission
between NASA and the Russian Space Agency (RSA). The SAGE III on the
Russian Meteor-3M was launched December 10, 2001 from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Response of Arctic and Subarctic soils in a changing Earth</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: RASCHER
Project URL: http://igras.geonet.ru/cwg/projects.html#rascher
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=262 

Soils of Polar Regions are a very important membrane in bio-cryospheric interactions, regulating natural and human-induced processes in ecosystems and landscapes of the North Latitudes. The knowledge of positive and negative feedbacks in the system climate-vegetation-soil-permafrost are of the crucial significance for understanding and forecasting response of this system to global change.
RASCHER addresses how climate variability and change can affect the soil systems of the polar (Subarctic and Arctic) regions and their sustainability. To provide accurate projections on the impact of climate change and increase of anthropogenic influence on these systems requires improved knowledge of its components and their linkages. Soil has both very inert and changeable parameters, which are altered differently because of climate change. RASCHER will mainly focus on the study of temporal change of labile soil characteristics (temperature, carbon fluxes and other gas fluxes, microbiota and microfauna) and of more stable soil characteristics (mineral composition, organic matter content and quality, morphological features, taxonomical status) in different kinds of frontiers (treeline, tundra-bog border, southern border of permafrost, contact zone of soil and permafrost table in a profile), which are expected to be changed first due to climate change. Together with climate-induced change the influence of the other regional and international processes shift of resource development, increased tourism and relevant infrastructure to the north on permafrost-affected soils will be studied. RASCHER will be based on both database analysis and field studies. The database on soil temperatures for dozens of meteorological stations of arctic and boreal regions for the period 50-100 years and the northern circumpolar soil database are already compiled and can be used for analysis. The field studies will be carried out in the different regions of Arctic and Subarctic during 2006-2008. To understand the effects of global change on northern polar soils firstly the long-term climatic trends and correlation of air and soil temperatures on the various depths will be carried out and the relevant models will be developed. Using the prognosis for climate change the spatial model of soil temperature change in northern polar latitudes will be elaborated. 
The potential development of northern industries, settlements and transport infrastructure (roads, pipelines) relevant to soil change will be forecasted together with social geographers and specialists in land management. The analysis of previously gained data on anthropogenic impact on permafrost-affected soils and field work in relevant human-changed environments will allow to elaborate the spatial prognostic model of anthropogenic change of Arctic and Subarctic soils. The Northern circumpolar soil database will help to differentiate this forecast related to kinds of soils and substrate. 
The role of thermal factor in composition and functioning of the biotic complex of tundra soils (microbiota, micro- and mesofauna) as well as the selective role of negative temperatures on the structure of soil microbiocenoses and the influence of cryogenesis on adaptive functions of soil microorganisms will be studied both in the field and in a laboratory using traditional and new (DNA analysis) methods. It allows comparing new data with results of studies carried out at the same locations 30-40 years ago and assessing if any climate-induced change of soil biota has taken place. The samples collected from the same places as 20 years ago will be analyzed for the 14C activity and the soil carbon renovation rates will be calculated (Cherkinsky-Brovkin model) and then will be compared with old samples to find out if it is any acceleration of carbon turnover due to global change. 
The frontier studies will concern the non-stability of soil thermic regimes, shrinking of isolated patches and the northward retreat of permafrost-affected soils, the assessments of possible soil change related to the vegetation transformation on the base of soil studies (carbon fluxes, humus quality, mineral composition, etc.) in different types of ecotones (forest-tundra, tundra-bog, forest-meadow, forest-bog, meadow-tundra). The other part of frontier studies is the detailed analysis of soil process at the interface of soil and permafrost tables. It concerns the study of the bio- and geochemical barrier on this interface and the study of the process of cryogenic lateral transportation at the contact zone of soil and permafrost table. This interface is the zone of high concentration of organic matter and other compounds, including pollutants. The detailed physico-chemical studies will allow determining the fate of this matter in case of permafrost thawing due to climate change or anthropogenic impact.
Soils will be linked with vegetation and changes in vegetation by linking various geospatial data layers to improve our knowledge and the distribution of soils and their environmental linkages

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Climate Change Science Program integrates federal research on climate and global change, as sponsored by thirteen federal agencies and overseen by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Council on Environmental Quality, the National Economic Council and the Office of
Management and Budget. 
During the past thirteen years the United States, through the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), has made the world&amp;#039;s largest scientific investment in the areas of climate change and global change research -- a total investment of almost $20 billion.   The USGCRP, in collaboration with several other national and international science programs, has documented and characterized several important aspects of the sources, abundances and lifetimes of greenhouse gases; has mounted extensive space-based monitoring systems for global-wide monitoring of climate and ecosystem parameters; has begun to address the complex issues of various aerosol species that may significantly influence climate parameters; has advanced our understanding of the global water and carbon cycles (but with major remaining uncertainties); and has developed several approaches to computer modeling of the global climate.

Because of the scientific accomplishments achieved by USGCRP and other research programs during a productive &amp;period of discovery and characterization&amp; since 1990, we are now ready to move into a new
&amp;period of differentiation and strategy investigation&amp;, which is the theme of the President&amp;#039;s Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI). In announcing the CCRI, the President directed the reestablishment of priorities for climate change research, including a focus on identifying the scientific information that can be developed within 2 to 5 years to assist the nation&amp;#039;s evaluation of optimal strategies to address global change risks.  The President also called for improved coordination among federal agencies, to assure that research results are made available to
all stakeholders, from national policy leaders to local resource managers.

The President&amp;#039;s direction for CCRI, focusing on the development of near-term decision-support information, requires close integration with the many existing programs managed under the U.S. Global Change Research Program.  This will ensure internal consistency of the CCRI research with the full body of global change information developed under the
USGCRP.

To accomplish this integration of USGCRP and CCRI activities, the Interagency Climate Change Science Program has assumed oversight of both
programs, with a single interagency committee responsible for the entire range of science projects sponsored by both programs.  The Interagency
Climate Change Science Program retains the responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Global Change Research Act of 1990, including its provisions for annual reporting of findings and short-term plans, scientific reviews by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council, and periodic publication of a ten-year strategic plan for the program.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">International Polar Year GEOTRACES: An international study of the biogeochemical cycles of Trace Elements and Isotopes in the Arctic and Southern Oceans</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The community of marine biogeochemists is developing a new international research initiative (the GEOTRACES program) that aims to identify, characterize and quantify processes that control the distribution of key trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) in the global ocean and their sensitivity to changing environmental conditions. Doing so will elucidate the supply of micronutrients to phytoplankton, contaminant dispersal in the ocean, and tracers of past and present ocean conditions. This initiative is prompted by the increasing recognition that TEIs are playing a crucial role as regulators and recorders of important biogeochemical and physical processes that control the structure and productivity of marine ecosystems, the dispersion of contaminants in the marine environment, the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and global climate. The primary objectives for the global GEOTRACES program are: •Determine global ocean distributions of selected TEIs •Evaluate the oceanic sources, sinks, and internal cycling of these TEIs and thereby characterize more completely their global biogeochemical cycles •Provide a baseline distribution as reference for assessing past and future changes. Specific objectives for polar GEOTRACES research include: •Characterize sources, sinks and internal cycling of trace elements that serve as essential micronutrients, including sources of material delivered to the ocean by rivers (primarily Arctic) and by glacial weathering (primarily Antarctic) of adjacent land masses •In collaboration with companion IPY initiatives, establish the role of micronutrient trace elements in regulating the structure and variability of polar marine ecosystems, with implications for interests ranging from fisheries (primarily Arctic) to the ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (primarily Southern Ocean). The IPY offers the opportunity to obtain synoptic TEI distributions among all major Polar ocean basins. The strong projects that have been proposed for the synoptic studies (Arctic and Antarctic) within IPY will offer the hydrographic and biological context that is needed for a robust interpretation of the TEI fields. Individual IPY – GEOTRACES proposals (EoIs) have been submitted to ICSU to: •Make GEOTRACES part of the synoptic studies planned for the polar oceans •Arctic: join forces with SNAPSHOT, SPACE, SEARCH and CARE, under the coordination of iAOOS, to achieve a detailed picture and improved understanding on the distribution of trace elements and their isotopes along - shelf-deep basin sections - sections across major pathways of Arctic ocean circulation •Southern Ocean: join forces with complementary IPY projects in physical and biological oceanography to perform multiple transects. Present options are: - Three dedicated GEOTRACES sections across “chokepoints” constraining the flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current: (1) an international program (BONUS; on a French vessel) studying together the South African margin/upwelling effect on water masses and the GoodHope/CLIVAR section down to 50°S, 0°W, (2) an international program aboard the Polarstern (German research vessel) connecting with the BONUS transect along 0° W and also working across the Drake Passage, and (3) a US study south of New Zealand. - Ancillary meridional sections where micronutrient cycling can be studied within the context of other programs (e.g., SASSI, CLIVAR, SCACE) - Both dedicated and ancillary cruises would be coordinated under the CASO (Climate in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean) umbrella to maximize interdisciplinary benefits from Southern Ocean research during the IPY.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
 The Clouds and the Earth s Radiant Energy System (CERES)
 experiment is one of the highest priority scientific satellite
 instruments developed for EOS. CERES products include both
 solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation from the top of the
 atmosphere to the Earth's surface. Cloud properties are
 determined using simultaneous measurements by other EOS
 instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging
 Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Analyses of the CERES data, which
 build upon the foundation laid by previous missions such as the
 Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), will lead to a better
 understanding of the role of clouds and the energy cycle in
 global climate change.

 CERES instruments were launched aboard the Tropical Rainfall
 Measuring Mission (TRMM) in November 1997 and on the EOS Terra
 satellite in December 1999. Two additional instruments will fly
 on the EOS Aqua spacecraft in 2002. Multiple satellites are
 needed to provide adequate temporal sampling since clouds and
 radiative fluxes vary throughout the day. The first 24 months
 of CERES data collected on both TRMM and Terra demonstrate that
 the CERES instruments are substantially improved over the ERBE
 instruments. The CERES data show lower noise, improved ties to
 the ground calibration in absolute terms, and smaller fields of
 view. CERES instrument calibration stability on TRMM and Terra
 is typically better than 0.2%, and calibration consistency from
 ground to space is better than 0.25%. Onboard calibration

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)
provides weather imagery and quantitative sounding data used to
support weather forecasting, sever storm tracking, and meteorological
research. This is a reimbursable project for NOAA. NASA builds and
launches the satellites. NOAA operates the satellites post
commissioning and check-out period and uses the data in weather
forecasts, Disaster management, public health, and aviation safety.

GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring
necessary for intensive data analysis. They circle the Earth in
a geosynchronous orbit, which means they orbit the equatorial
plane of the Earth at a speed matching the Earth&amp;#039;s
rotation. This allows them to hover continuously over one
position on the surface. The geosynchronous plane is about
35,800 km (22,300 miles) above the Earth, high enough to allow
the satellites a full-disc view of the Earth.  Because they stay
above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil
for the atmospheric &amp;triggers&amp; for severe weather conditions
such as tornadoes, flash floods, hail storms, and
hurricanes. When these conditions develop the GOES satellites
are able to monitor storm development and track their movements.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">The Structure and Evolution of the Polar Stratosphere and Mesosphere and Links to the Troposphere during IPY.</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The evolution of stratospheric ozone and other important and related atmospheric constituents in Polar Regions is tightly coupled to a wide range of processes acting within and outside the winter polar vortices and through the entire region from the surface to the mesopause. Much of the current understanding of these processes has been achieved within the programme of SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate), a WCRP core project, and other international projects with which it maintains collaborative links. The IPY programme offers a unique opportunity for SPARC to assemble a range of scientific expertise to study the Antarctic and Arctic Polar Vortices, the loci of key chemical and physical processes associated with ozone depletion and its eventual recovery, as well as of key features of the dynamical coupling between the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere in polar and sub-polar regions. The central goal of the SPARC IPY programme (hereinafter referred to as SPARC-IPY) is to document as completely as possible the dynamics and chemistry of the polar vortices and physical properties relevant to processes such as the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. To achieve this detailed picture and yield a unique synthesis of data on the polar middle atmosphere, SPARC-IPY will facilitate analysis of available research and operational satellite data, as well as ground-based and aircraft data, and encourage work on data assimilation and inter-comparison of assimilated data sets. This will include data from new measurement systems as well as from enhanced measurement programmes with established systems. To complement results provided by new measurement programmes, weather services carrying out routine radiosonde and ozonesonde measurements will be encouraged to increase the frequency of the observations and to store the data with full resolution. As the lead organization, the SPARC Project will coordinate the SPARC-IPY programme, promote specific new initiatives and organize workshops and meetings to facilitate research and dissemination of results. These efforts will be carried out in the context of the SPARC Project core thematic programmes of Stratospheric Chemistry and Climate; Stratosphere-Troposphere Dynamical Coupling; and Detection, Attribution, and Prediction of Stratospheric Change. SPARC-IPY is the lead EoI for sub-cluster 7.1 (IPY SPARC). The EoIs that are clustered within this proposal will constitute key components of this programme (consortium members are listed in section 4.2) which will include the following specific components: (a) An Arctic measurement programme will document the “state of the Arctic middle atmosphere” during the IPY (EoI 11, PASSMeC). This will use data from ground based and satellite systems, centered on four lidar systems located at sites across the Arctic. These lidar measurements will be coordinated with satellite and radiosonde/ozonesonde measurements. These lidars are distributed under different regimes of the Arctic middle atmosphere and provide measurements that are critical for understanding the role of tides, planetary and gravity waves in the large-scale circulation. (b) A data assimilation, modelling and analysis component will focus on assimilation and analysis of these observations to yield a comprehensive picture of the observed circulation and facilitate prediction of changes in the circulation and associated physical and chemical responses. In addition this component will include archival of assimilation products (analyses and forecasts) arising from participating middle atmosphere assimilation groups during the IPY period. Such products will be routinely produced at weather forecast centers using models with vertical domains that extend above the stratopause. Research groups employing chemistry transport models or chemistry climate models will also participate. These activities are critical for understanding the structure and evolution of the Arctic vortex, the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, the depletion of ozone, and the initiation of anomalous weather regimes associated with the Arctic Oscillation. A specific component activity will include analysis of the dynamics and chemistry associated with Stratospheric Sudden Warmings (SSWs) in the Arctic Polar atmosphere during the IPY (EoI 959, CMAM-IPY). The Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM), which extends from the ground to above the mesopause and includes comprehensive and coupled chemistry, radiation and dynamics, will be used to analyse SSWs during the IPY using a 3D-Var data assimilation scheme. (c) Data available from instruments in operation at different Antarctic and relevant continental sub polar sites in the southern tip of South America, where the Antarctic polar vortex/ozone hole system passes over inhabited regions, in combination with satellite data. will be collected and interpreted. Organization of special campaign periods will be promoted in collaboration with the various national agencies involved in the operation of these sites. CTM runs of relevant events using the AMR-CTM with the MECCA/MESSY chemistry module (Argentina/UK/Germany) will be carried out. The SPARC-IPY programme will also link with other closely related IPY activities (see section 3.5). The services of the SPARC Data Center will be made available to facilitate acquisition and archiving of key data that will be used for projects or generated by them during the IPY period (see section 3.6).

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Network to characterize the means of the climate-forcing properties of aerosols</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: POLAR-AOD
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=171
The proposed activity aims at establishing a bipolar network to obtain data needed to quantify properties of aerosols at high latitudes, including seasonal background concentrations by measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD), spectral characterizations, and the evolutionary patterns of the natural and anthropogenic processes that perturb the aerosol cycles. An effort to quantify direct and indirect climate forcing by polar aerosols will be made through a set of closure experiments using observations in conjunction with model calculation and satellite data.
The co-operation in the frame of POLAR-AOD will allow the following: 
1. - Definition of calibration procedures among the various sun-radiometers operating in Polar regions, in order to achieve homogeneous AOD (aerosol optical depth) evaluations and maintain a set of reference instruments in a high mountain station. Some of the instruments will be used to constitute a traveller system from one station to the other with the aim of attaining round robin inter-comparison. Regular inter-comparison campaigns (biennial) will be organized in order to compare not only calibration constants but also instrumental characteristics, such as sensitivity and influence of diffuse light. The first inter-comparison campaign, scheduled for spring 2006 at Ny-Alesund, will be used also to define and adjust the methodology and calculation procedures, like that aimed at evaluating relative optical air mass and trace-gas corrections.
2 . - Improvement of "in-situ" optical and chemical measurements, with an effort to operate size and time-resolved aerosol composition and concentration sampling on a long-term base (EoI ID 557).
3. - Establishment of a data bank for spectral sun-photometric measurements (AOD archive), in-situ measurements and any other aerosol related parameters useful for assessing the quantification of aerosols and their radiative effects. This archive will fill the gap for the polar regions within the global aerosol climatology, where there is an urgent need for high-quality data on aerosol abundance and physico-chemical characteristics on a regional scale. The information is necessary to better constrain climate model simulations and improve the interpretation of remotely sensed data. Particular attention will be paid to retrospective analyses of historical data-sets, mainly from Russian Arctic and Antarctic stations. They will be recovered and stored in the archive.
4. - Determination of reliable procedures for analysing sun-photometric and sun-radiometric data in order to describe realistically the specific conditions occurring in the polar regions. Standard programmes will be developed and supplied to the research groups involved, including cloud rejection algorithms and radiometric data analysis.
5 - Organisation of international workshops for the presentation of the results from the various polar programs, and for the discussion of common strategies and goals, including aspects of logistics within inter-calibration activities and data exchange.
In Antarctica, the actual field activities will benefit from the setting up of a new international long-term monitoring programme, called TAVERN (Quantification of Tropospheric Aerosol and Thin Clouds Variability, including Radiation Budget over the East Antarctic Plateau) at the recently established Italian-French station Dome Concordia (EoI ID 198). Year-round measurements based on LIDAR, Sun and Star photometer and &amp;in-situ&amp; aerosol systems will make it possible to study in detail inter-annual and seasonal variation of aerosols over the high Antarctic Plateau, and also to obtain information on the thin cloud optical depth. The normal activities in other stations will be extended during the IPY operational period (EoI ID 797). The POLAR-AOD observations will complement the SRB measurements which are developed at other stations (Syowa, South Pole, Neumayer) in the frame of the BSRN (GCOS) activities, providing an important contribution for assessing forcing by aerosols.
In the Arctic, additional strong field activities will be promoted at the Greenland Summit Station (EoI ID 530) and Tiksi (EoI ID 820), during the IPY operational period. Real-time measurements of physical, chemical and optical properties of aerosols will allow the constitution of a data set in the Arctic, equivalent to the one acquired over the Antarctic Plateau, Summit being a natural counterpart of Dome Concordia. Also in Ny-Alesund, research activities related to aerosols will increase as a consequence of the efforts of Norway, Poland, Germany, Japan and Italy (EoIs ID 165, ID 597). The network will give support in obtaining high-quality integrated data from the large amount of field activities. Participation on cruises organised in the framework of the Arctic Experiment (AREX) and the airborne ASTAR (Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosol, Clouds, and Radiation) activities will lead to a considerable improvement in knowledge on the vertical and spatial distribution of aerosols in the European Arctic. The present studies will complement the activities promoted by the SEARCH Program (NOAA's Study of Environmental Arctic Change). Finally the information obtained will allow participants to assess the influence of mid-latitude aerosol sources in the observed Arctic aerosol budget. 
POLAR-AOD (EoIs ID 299, ID 557) will join the efforts of the IASOA proposal (EoI ID 138), in the task of co-ordinating different programmes of long-term atmospheric observatories in the Arctic with the purpose of setting up a circumpolar ring around the central Arctic region. The second aim is to fulfil the need for an integrated larger bi-polar network in the field of atmospheric sciences.

The coastal zone is the interface through which land-ocean exchanges in the Arctic are mediated and it is the region of most high-latitude human activities. The coastal margin hosts a complex interaction of marine, terrestrial and atmospheric processes that are extremely vulnerable to predicted environmental changes and anthropogenic stressors. These high-latitude coasts are typically permafrost-dominated and suffer from rapid erosion with serious implications for ecosystems and communities (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) - key finding #5). Furthermore, changes in inputs of water and constituents (nutrients, sediments, dissolved inorganic matter and contaminants) from major Arctic rivers have the potential to fundamentally alter biogeochemical cycling and productivity in the coastal zone and in the Arctic marginal seas (continental shelves). Changes in the Arctic coastal zone, including coastal erosion and riverine fluxes, will not only affect regional biological and human systems, but are also likely to influence the global system. For example, degradation of coastal and offshore permafrost may lead to the release of greenhouse gases (GHG), and increases in freshwater inputs may alter regional as well as large-scale ocean circulation and climate patterns. To detect and quantify trajectories in coastal/shelf systems, their components and transformations must first be monitored. A coordinated monitoring programme incorporating diverse regions and providing site-specific, fine-scale baseline and time-series data will yield maximum value, facilitating local and circum-Arctic studies, such as validation of multiscale biodiversity and coastal community models. 

To address these issues, it is proposed that an internationally coordinated circum-Arctic network of coastal and marginal seas observatories (~20 key sites including deltas and estuaries of major Siberian and North American rivers) be established within the IPY 2007-2008 framework based on ecoregion representation criteria. The sites will be loci for multi-disciplinary, multi-resolution studies set within a broader eco- and socio-regional frame of reference and will include sensitive areas with varying degrees of human impact. Site selection will be coordinated with local communities and will build upon existing monitoring programmes and data availability. In particular, the circum-Arctic coastal key sites established within the IASC/IPA/IGBP-LOICZ project Artic Coastal Dynamics (ACD), the river monitoring stations installed at down-stream locations on the 6 largest rivers draining the pan-Arctic watershed (Yenisey, Lena, Ob, Kolyma, Yukon, Mackenzie) as part of the NSF-ARCSS Freshwater Initiative (FWI), and the pilot version of the Hudson Bay Complex Observatory (MERICA) will be considered.

The recommended strategy is outlined in five steps:
(1) Initial site characterisation and representation assessment: 
(a) acquisition of comprehensive, high-resolution imagery of the circum-Arctic coastline, (
b) physical (atmospheric, terrestrial, inter-tidal and marine coastal conditions), 
(c) ecological (marine and terrestrial classification, habitat mapping, assessment of biodiversity indicators and components), 
(d) biogeochemical fluxes of major and minor elements and greenhouse gases 
(e) Socio-economic (general situation, interaction of resource users, assessment of resources used, local knowledge of coastal processes, state of legal and administrative regulations);

(2) Monitoring of changes: 
(a) physical (atmospheric and oceanographic forcing, permafrost parameters, coastal terrestrial and marine morphology, riverine fluxes), 
(b) ecological (habitats, biodiversity, living resource assessment) 
(c) biogeochemistry, (C, N, and gas fluxes, environmental quality, biological production and biogeochemical cycles), 
(d) socio-economic (industrial production, plans and potential constraints for development, quality of life, local economy, population and demography, social problems of native peoples);

(3) Data analyses: 
(a) change detection, 
(b) identification of interdependencies amongst physical, biological, social, and ecological parameters; 

(4) Data/information management: 
(a) metadata standards, 
(b) Arctic spatial data infrastructure, 
(c) web accessible databases and products (e.g. maps), 
(d) data accessibility to local and scientific communities;

(5) Synthesis: formulation of models at multiple levels (conceptual to regional and global numerical) incorporating interdependent physical, biological and environmental changes in response to natural and anthropogenic forcing, development of response strategies.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This award supported a four year project to develop of better understanding the
ice streams of the Ross Sea Embayment (A--F) which drain the interior West
Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) by rapidly moving vast quantities of ice to the
calving front of the Ross Ice Shelf. The project examined the role of these ice
streams as buffers between the interior ice and the floating ice shelves. The
reasons for their fast flow, the factors controlling their current
grounding-line-, margin-, and head-positions are crucial to any attempt at
modeling the WAIS system and predicting the future of the ice sheet. For the
Antarctic ice streams of the Siple Coast, the transition from no-sliding (or
all internal deformation) to motion dominated by sliding is defined as the
"onset-region". To fully understand (and adequately model) the WAIS, this onset
region must be better understood. The lateral margins of the ice streams are
also a transition that need better explanation. Hypotheses on controls of the
location of the onset region range from the "purely-glaciologic" to the
"purely-geologic. Thus, to model the ice sheet accurately, the basal boundary
conditions (roughness, wetness, till properties) and a good subglacial geologic
map, showing the distribution, thickness, and properties of the sedimentary
basins, are required. These parameters can be estimated from seismic, radar,
and other geophysical methods. The transition region of ice stream D was
studied in detail with this coupled geophysical experiment. In addition,
selected other locations on ice streams C &amp; D were made, in order to compare
and contrast conditions with the main site on ice stream D. Site-selection for
the main camp wasbased on existing radar, GPS, and satellite data as well as
input from the modeling community.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">As it grows, the Southern Fire Portal (SFP) aims to become a &amp;one-stop-shop&amp; for fire related publications, datasets, databases, decision-support tools, models, glossaries, interactive CD-ROMs, videos, and state-of-the-knowledge literature syntheses. Combined with advanced search and a future integrated fire thesaurus, the goal is to find existing information quickly, efficiently, and for free. 

The Southern Fire Portal&amp;#039;s objectives are to improve fire science organization and accessibility by integrating and expanding three comprehensive and complementary sources of fire information: 1) the Fire Research and Management Exchange System (FRAMES), 2) the Encyclopedia of Southern Fire Science (ESFS), and 3) the Tall Timbers Research Station E.V. Komarek Fire Ecology Database and Thesaurus. 

The combination of these powerful sources of information is synergistic, adding tremendous user-value to each source. The SFP is much more than a website; it is the gateway for ongoing information and technology transfer between the fire management and research communities, and their publics.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
SCAMP is a cooperative mapping project between the U.S. Geological
Survey and the California Division of Mines and Geology. The project
provides a variety of geologic-information products for public access
in southern California-including geologic and geophysical maps and
reports that describe the geologic setting and geologic history of
southern California. These maps and reports are providing a foundation
for specialized investigations of geologic hazards and earth
resources, and can be used for land-use planning decisions that
involve earth-science data.

The project has two objectives:

* Develop a uniform geologic-map data base for southwestern California
that will provide a geologic foundation for a broad range of societal
applications--including evaluations of geologic hazards, natural
resources, and environmental quality

* Determine the geologic framework and geologic history of
southwestern California, with emphasis on the evolution of the San
Andreas fault system.


These objectives are achieved mainly by making general-purpose
geologic maps in digital form. Studies of isotope geology and
geochronology, regional geophysics and geochemistry, paleontology,
geomorphology, and pedology provide essential information that is
incorporated into the map data base.

For the entire project area, the geologic-map data base will be at
1:100,000 scale; where warranted by geologic and societal issues,
additional maps will be produced at 1:24,000 and 1:48,000 scale. The
maps produced may include both surface-geology maps and
subsurface-geology maps generated from drill records and from
geophysical data. The maps are digitally produced using the Geographic
Information System (GIS) software ARC/INFO, and graphic files are
available for downloading in several formats via anonymous ftp. Future
plans include map release of digital geologic folios on CD-ROM. The
primary folio layer will be a digital geologic map, mostly captured at
1:100,000 scale.

 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

The third in the series of CAMEX field studies (CAMEX-3) is planned
for August - September, 1998. This field campaign will be devoted to
the study of hurricane tracking and intensification using NASA-funded
aircraft remote sensing instrumentation. The NASA ER-2 and DC-8 are
the primary aircraft platforms currently planned for the deployment;
however, collaborations with the National Weather Service/Tropical
Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center and National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration/Hurricane Research Division are being
developed so that actual mission sorties may involve as many as five
to six aircraft.

The remote sensing instrumentation to be utilized by NASA during
CAMEX-3 will yield high spatial and temporal information of hurricane
structure, dynamics, and motion. These data, when analyzed within the
context of more traditional aircraft, satellite, and ground-based
radar observations, should provide additional insight to hurricane
modelers and forecasters who continually strive to improve hurricane
predictions. The ultimate goal of CAMEX-3 is to provide information
which could someday assist in decreasing the size of coastal
evacuation areas and increasing the warning time for those areas.

Demographic information is usually provided on a national basis. But
we know that countries are ephemeral phenomena. As an alternate scheme
one might use ecological zones rather than nation states. But there is
no agreement as to what these zones should be. By way of contrast
global environmental studies using satellites as collection devices
yield results indexed by latitude and longitude. Thus it makes sense
to assemble the terrestrial arrangement of people in a compatible
manner. This alternative is explored here, using latitude/longitude
quadrilaterals as bins for population information. This data format
also has considerable advantage for analytical studies.

      Dataset Variables

There are four files in this dataset. Each file contains one
variable. The variables are:

1. population counts (i.e., the number of people in each 5' x 5'

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
In 1992, the US Congress authorized the procurement, launch and
operation of a new Landsat satellite. This new system, Landsat 7, was
launched on April 15, 1999. It is the latest in a series of Landsat
earth observation satellites dating back to 1972. The twenty-nine year
record of data acquired by the Landsat satellites constitutes the
longest continuous record of the earth's continental
surfaces. Preservation of the existing record and continuation of the
Landsat capability were identified in the law as critical to land
surface monitoring and global change research.

Landsat 7 has a unique and essential role in the realm of earth
observing satellites in orbit. No other earth observing system matches
Landsat's combination of synoptic coverage, high spatial resolution,
spectral range and radiometric calibration. In addition, the Landsat
Program is committed to provide Landsat digital data to the user
community in greater quantities, more quickly and at lower cost than
at any previous time in the history of the program.

The Landsat 7 spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin, Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania. The ETM+ instrument is a product of Hughes Santa Barbara
Remote Sensing. Construction of both was managed through contracts
between the manufacturers and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,
Greenbelt, Maryland.

The Landsat Program, as defined by Congress in 1992 and amended by
Presidential Decision Directive/NSTC-3 in May, 1994, was managed
cooperatively by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
and the USGS. NASA was responsibility for construction of the
spacecraft and instrument. The Landsat Program is part of the NASA's
global change initiative - the Earth Observing System, administered by
the NASA Office of Mission to Planet Earth. NOAA no longer
participates in the Landsat 7 program. Landsat 7 is now operated by
USGS. Data processing, archiving and distribution is performed by
USGS. These functions will be executed in coordination with the EDC
Distributed Active Archive Center (EDC DAAC) of NASA's Earth Observing
System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) at EDC.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle (UAV) represents an exciting new technology that can contribute in significant and unique ways to lightning and storm observations. In turn, these measurements can be linked to global scale processes (e.g., global water and energy cycle, climate variability and prediction, atmospheric chemistry) to provide an improved understanding of the total Earth system.

We have chosen the ALTUS II aircraft produced by General Atomic-Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) for the ACES investigation. The decision to select GA-ASI as the partner was based on a number of factors including the maturity level of the ALTUS aircraft, its performance capabilities and proven flight record, and the successful integration and flight of the ACES payload on ALTUS in September 2000 under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) activity with IDEA managed by one of the Co-Investigators (Co-Is), Dr. R. Goldberg.

We propose to fly ALTUS as a component of a currently funded field experiment. That field experiment, in the vicinity of NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC), is being conducted to both validate the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite measurements, and investigate lightning activity and its relationship to storm morphology. The ACES payload, already developed and flown on ALTUS, includes several electrical, magnetic, and optical sensors to remotely characterize the lightning activity and the electrical environment within and around thunderstorms.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Antarctica has great value as a natural laboratory for scientific research on issues of global relevance. Unless your natural features can be preserved from pollution and increasing unrest due primarily to significant human activity, scientific activity could be seriously restricted. The sensitivity of the Antarctic marine and terrestrial environments indicates that special precautions must be taken to preserve them.

Since the ratification of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection, or the Madrid Protocol (National Law No. 24,216), the Treaty system was reinforced by a series of rules that involve the commitment of the parties in the overall protection of the environment and its dependent and associated ecosystems and designated Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science.

Environmental protection of Antarctica has two goals: one is related to the maintenance of high productivity and ecological relationships in the Southern Ocean, and the other with the maintenance of the environment in pristine condition. The main value to keep in Antarctica is its sole source of information virtually free of pollution or human, for geophysical, geological and biological useful to humanity

Oceans cover some 71% of the world's surface. They play an essential
role in the maintenance of life on the planet and yet are often
threatened by human activities. The coastal zones, which include some
of the most diverse and productive marine ecosystems, such as coral
reefs, seagrass beds, mangrove forests, tidal mudflats, and kelp
forests, are particularly important and vulnerable. WCMC's marine
programme aims to compile information on these ecosystems and the
conservation of the species which they harbour. A number of ongoing
projects contribute to the overall programme:

Coral Reefs Since the publication, in 1988 of the 3-volume Coral Reefs
of the World WCMC has been acclaimed as a centre of expertise in these
important ecosystems. In support of ReefBase, a project run by the
International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM)
in Manila, WCMC has been developing digital maps of coral reefs of the
world. Draft maps have been prepared for all countries and for 45, the
reefs have now been mapped at scales of 1:250,000 or better. These
maps have been incorporated into the CD of Reefbase, a highly detailed
database first released in 1996. These maps are also available on
Internet at the following address
http://www.wcmc.org.uk/marine/data/.
The use of GIS for storing the data has enabled the calculation of
global and regional estimates of reef area.

Mangrove Atlas In association with the International Society for
Mangrove Ecosystems and the International Tropical Timber
Organization, WCMC has recently completed work on a World Mangrove
Atlas, published in 1997.

Mangrove Protected Areas In 1993, a survey was undertaken of protected
areas with mangrove ecosystems. This resulted in the development
of a database of some 1200 protected mangrove sites.

Poster Map of Coral Reefs and Mangroves of the World Using mapped
coral reef and mangrove data, an educational poster has been
published, with support from BHP Ltd.

Marine Protected Areas The WCMC Protected Areas Database includes some
35,000 protected areas.

Threatened and Endemic Marine Species A large number of threatened
marine organisms are recorded in the WCMC species database.
Data have also been exchanged with Fishbase, a global database on
fish distribution maintained by ICLARM, and with the IUCN Coral
Reef Fish Specialist Group. Related publications include Dolphins,
Porpoises and Whales of the World; the IUCN Red Data Book and The
IUCN Invertebrate Red Data Book.

Sea Turtle Nest Sites Preliminary maps of feeding and nesting sites of
all species of marine turtles have been produced for the world.

Sirenia Similar work is now being undertaken to map the global
distribution of Sirenians (manatees and Dugong).

IPIECA and the Biodiversity Map Library Biodiversity Map Library (BML)
is a user-interface designed to store and access a range of
environmental information in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
format.

Seagrass Beds In collaboration with IUCN Marine Programme, a global
survey of the extent and status of
seagrass beds is planned.

The Global Change SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training (START),
through the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global
Environmental Change (IHDP), the International Geosphere-Biospehere
Program (IGBP), and the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), has
developed the concept of a global system of regional networks of
institutions. The START mission is:
To develop a system of regional networks of collaborating scientists and
institutions:
     - to conduct research on regional aspects of global change
     - to assess the causes and impacts of regional global change,
     - and to provide relevant information to policy makers and governments
To enhance scientific capacity in developing countries by
strengthening and connecting existing institutions, by training global
change scientists and by providing them with improved and enhanced
access to data, communication technology and research results.
To help mobilize the resources required to augment existing global
change scientific capabilities infrastructure and activities in
developing countries.
START has established a network of Regional Research Networks (RRN),
with affiliated Regional Research Sites (RRS) and at least one
Regional Research Center (RRC).
Direction and oversight for START is provided by the START Scientific
Steering Committee (START-SSC). The START-SSC also serves to provide
an informal forum for discussions between governmental and
non-governmental initiatives.
Members of the START-SSC include scientists associated to its three
sponsoring programmes (IGBP, WCRP, and IHDP) as well as individuals
connected with national, multilateral and intergovernmental
bodies. For example, members of the START-SSC are affiliated with
components of the UN systems, the International Group of Funding
Agencies (IGFA), the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research
(APN), the European Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH) and
the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI).
The development of the various START regional networks is guided by
regional START committees comprised of scientists and representatives
of appropriate national and regional-level bodies. The International
START Secretariat, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the
implementation and development of START research networks.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 was developed from the earlier HadCM2 model. Various improvements were applied to the 19 level atmosphere model and the 20 level ocean model and as a result the model requires no artificial flux adjustments to prevent excessive climate drift. The atmosphere and ocean exchange information once per day, heat and water fluxes being conserved  ... exactly. Momentum fluxes are interpolated between atmosphere and ocean grids so are not conserved precisely, but this non-conservation is not thought to have a significant effect. The main differences from the previous HadCM2 model are a significantly more sophisticated radiation scheme; the inclusion of the direct impact of convection on momentum; and the inclusion of a new land surface scheme that includes a better representation of evaporation, freezing and melting of soil moisture. The HadCM3 model was used by the Hadley Centre to provide input for the IPCC Third Assessment Report. The simulation output contained in this dataset is part of the 2nd QUMP (Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Predictions) Fully Coupled Transient Ensemble and reflects the IPCC's SRES B1 future emissions scenario. This run is part of a 17 element control ensemble produced by the QUMP project.

      The principal goal of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE)
      mission is to investigate the chemical processes that are
      involved in the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere. The ACE
      mission will work in conjunction with other instruments and
      missions planned by NASA, the European Space Agency, and other
      international partners over the next decade to gain a better
      understanding of the chemistry and dynamics of the atmosphere
      that affect the Earth?s protective ozone layer. The analysis of
      the large amount of data that will be collected will lead to a
      more informed assessment of international environmental policies
      such as the Montreal Protocol for the elimination of
      chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

      The overall objective of the ACE mission is to improve our
      understanding of the depletion of the ozone layer, focusing
      close attention to what is happening over Canada and the
      Arctic. The measurements obtained by the ACE-FTS and MAESTRO
      instruments will be combined with data gathered by ground-based,
      balloon-based and other space-based projects in order to obtain
      the best possible information to predict future trends relating
      to the ozone layer and its depletion.

      The Government of Canada is working with the international
      scientific community to determine the extent and causes of
      atmospheric changes that threaten human health and safety. Sound
      scientific data is essential to finding effective solutions to
      problems such as depletion of the ozone layer and climate
      change. Environment Canada?s studies of the ozone layer, which
      began over 50 years ago, support a worldwide research and
      atmospheric monitoring program. And, through the leadership of
      the Canadian Space Agency, Canada is also involved in research
      studying the ozone layer from space.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
Since 1991, USGS scientists with the NAWQA program have been
collecting and analyzing data and information in more than 50
major river basins and aquifers across the Nation. The goal is
to develop long-term consistent and comparable information on
streams, ground water, and aquatic ecosystems to support sound
management and policy decisions. The NAWQA program is designed
to answer these questions:

1.What is the condition of our Nation's streams and ground
water?

2.How are these conditions changing over time?

3.How do natural features and human activities affect these
conditions?  How does NAWQA answer these questions?

Answering these questions:

Study design and methods are nationally consistent so that
water-quality conditions can be compared on a regional and
national basis.

Studies are long-term and cyclical so that trends in water
quality can be analyzed to determine whether conditions are
getting better or worse.

Studies relate human activities (contaminant sources, land and
chemical use) and natural factors (soils, geology, hydrology,
climate) to water quality, aquatic life, and stream habitat so
that findings help with decisions about managing water resources
and protecting drinking water and aquatic ecosystems.

USGS scientists interact with government officials, resource
managers, industry representatives, and other interested parties
so that findings are relevant to decision makers.

USGS scientists cover a range of disciplines, including
hydrology, geology, geophysics, biology, geography, and
statistics so that the interdependent nature of river basins and
aquifer systems can be analyzed.

USGS is committed to making its unbiased scientific information

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes (TCSP) mission is an Earth science field research investigation sponsored by the Science Mission Directorate of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The field phase was conducted during the period July 1-27, 2005 out of the Juan Santamaria Airfield in San Jose , Costa Rica . The TCSP field experiment flew 12 NASA ER-2 science flights, including missions to Hurricanes Dennis and Emily, Tropical Storm Gert and an eastern Pacific mesoscale complex that may possibly have further developed into Tropical Storm Eugene. The P-3 aircraft from the NOAA Hurricane Research Division (HRD) flew 18 coordinated missions with the NASA research aircraft to investigate developing tropical disturbances. Additionally, the Aerosonde uninhabited aerial vehicle flew 8 surveillance missions and the Instituto Meteorologico Nacionale (IMN) of Costa Rica launched RS-92 balloon sondes daily to gather humidity measurements and provide validation of the water vapor measurements.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: SPARC
Project URL: http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/SPARC/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=217

The evolution of stratospheric ozone and other important and related
atmospheric constituents in Polar Regions is tightly coupled to a wide
range of processes acting within and outside the winter polar vortices
and through the entire region from the surface to the mesopause. Much
of the current understanding of these processes has been achieved
within the programme of SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role
in Climate), a WCRP core project, and other international projects
with which it maintains collaborative links. The IPY programme offers
a unique opportunity for SPARC to assemble a range of scientific
expertise to study the Antarctic and Arctic Polar Vortices, the loci
of key chemical and physical processes associated with ozone depletion
and its eventual recovery, as well as of key features of the dynamical
coupling between the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere in
polar and sub-polar regions. The central goal of the SPARC IPY
programme (hereinafter referred to as SPARC-IPY) is to document as
completely as possible the dynamics and chemistry of the polar
vortices and physical properties relevant to processes such as the
formation of polar stratospheric clouds. To achieve this detailed
picture and yield a unique synthesis of data on the polar middle
atmosphere, SPARC-IPY will facilitate analysis of available research
and operational satellite data, as well as ground-based and aircraft
data, and encourage work on data assimilation and inter-comparison of
assimilated data sets. This will include data from new measurement
systems as well as from enhanced measurement programmes with
established systems. To complement results provided by new measurement
programmes, weather services carrying out routine radiosonde and
ozonesonde measurements will be encouraged to increase the frequency
of the observations and to store the data with full resolution. As the
lead organization, the SPARC Project will coordinate the SPARC-IPY
programme, promote specific new initiatives and organize workshops and
meetings to facilitate research and dissemination of results. These
efforts will be carried out in the context of the SPARC Project core
thematic programmes of Stratospheric Chemistry and Climate;
Stratosphere-Troposphere Dynamical Coupling; and Detection,
Attribution, and Prediction of Stratospheric Change. SPARC-IPY is the
lead EoI for sub-cluster 7.1 (IPY SPARC). The EoIs that are clustered
within this proposal will constitute key components of this programme
(consortium members are listed in section 4.2) which will include the
following specific components: (a) An Arctic measurement programme
will document the state of the Arctic middle atmosphere
during the IPY (EoI 11, PASSMeC). This will use data from ground based
and satellite systems, centered on four lidar systems located at sites
across the Arctic. These lidar measurements will be coordinated with
satellite and radiosonde/ozonesonde measurements. These lidars are
distributed under different regimes of the Arctic middle atmosphere
and provide measurements that are critical for understanding the role
of tides, planetary and gravity waves in the large-scale
circulation. (b) A data assimilation, modelling and analysis component
will focus on assimilation and analysis of these observations to yield
a comprehensive picture of the observed circulation and facilitate
prediction of changes in the circulation and associated physical and
chemical responses. In addition this component will include archival
of assimilation products (analyses and forecasts) arising from
participating middle atmosphere assimilation groups during the IPY
period. Such products will be routinely produced at weather forecast
centers using models with vertical domains that extend above the
stratopause. Research groups employing chemistry transport models or
chemistry climate models will also participate. These activities are
critical for understanding the structure and evolution of the Arctic
vortex, the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, the depletion of
ozone, and the initiation of anomalous weather regimes associated with
the Arctic Oscillation. A specific component activity will include
analysis of the dynamics and chemistry associated with Stratospheric
Sudden Warmings (SSWs) in the Arctic Polar atmosphere during the IPY
(EoI 959, CMAM-IPY). The Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM),
which extends from the ground to above the mesopause and includes
comprehensive and coupled chemistry, radiation and dynamics, will be
used to analyse SSWs during the IPY using a 3D-Var data assimilation
scheme. (c) Data available from instruments in operation at different
Antarctic and relevant continental sub polar sites in the southern tip
of South America, where the Antarctic polar vortex/ozone hole system
passes over inhabited regions, in combination with satellite
data. will be collected and interpreted. Organization of special
campaign periods will be promoted in collaboration with the various
national agencies involved in the operation of these sites. CTM runs
of relevant events using the AMR-CTM with the MECCA/MESSY chemistry
module (Argentina/UK/Germany) will be carried out. The SPARC-IPY
programme will also link with other closely related IPY activities
(see section 3.5). The services of the SPARC Data Center will be made
available to facilitate acquisition and archiving of key data that
will be used for projects or generated by them during the IPY period
(see section 3.6).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">International Polar Heritage Conference.
Since the first International Polar Year in 1882-83 there have been a number of major international science initiatives in polar regions. All of these events have been milestones in the history of mankind. Tangible evidence of many of these sites remains scattered around the frozen extremities of our planet.

The International Polar Heritage Committee (IPHC) has as one of its objectives;
…… “to promote international co-operation in the protection and conservation of non-indigenous heritage in the Arctic and Antarctic”

It is therefore both relevant and important that the IPHC promotes an IPY event and our intention is to host a conference at which a series of presentations on a variety of polar heritage subjects will be delivered by invited specialists. The format is intended to allow for discussion on specific issues.

The theme of the conference will be PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION OF SCIENTIFIC BASES IN THE POLAR REGIONS.
Presentations will focus on many sites, ranging from the heroic age historic huts of Antarctica, to the remains of scientific/exploratory bases in the Arctic. Many of these were former IPY stations.

Aspects to be discussed will be wide ranging and may include issues such as management, conservation techniques, accessibility and the recording and dissemination of data and information.

It is proposed that he IPHC will subsequently publish presentations and proceedings from the conference in book and possibly digital form to make them available for wider distribution to the polar heritage protection community and other interested persons.

VENUE
Barrow Arctic Science Consortium, Alaska – site of one of the original IPY stations (1882-1883).

TIMING
October 2007 – actual dates yet to be finalized.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Integrated Forest Study (IFS) was a project to evaluate the
effects of atmospheric deposition on nutrient cycling in forest
ecosystems. Deposition and nutrient cycling were monitored at 17
forested sites in the northwestern, northeastern, and southeastern
United States and in Canada and Norway. The IFS was primarily funded
by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

The Oak Ridge Loblolly Pine site was located on the U.S. Department of
Energy Reservation, National Environmental Research Park, near Oak
Ridge, Tennessee.  The site consisted of loblolly pine with an
understory of red maple, yellow poplar, black cherry, and dogwood. The
ground cover consisted of extensive grass with patches of blackberry
and honeysuckle. The site was located on an alluvial soil derived from
shale on one of the upper terraces of the Clinch River.

Data collected included biomass and nutrient content of the overstory,
understory, floor, and soils; atmospheric deposition, throughfall,
stemflow, and soil solution fluxes for major ions; organic matter and
nutrient fluxes; and atmospheric concentrations of ions from wet and
dry deposition.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) is a
program initiated by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)
to observe, understand and model the hydrological cycle and
energy fluxes in the atmosphere, at land surface and in the
upper oceans. GEWEX is an integrated program of research,
observations, and science activities ultimately leading to the
prediction of global and regional climate change. The
International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO) is the focal point for
the planning and implementation of all GEWEX Projects and
activities.

The goal of the GEWEX Program is to reproduce and predict, by
means of suitable models, the variations of the global
hydrological regime, its impact on atmospheric and surface
dynamics, and variations in regional hydrological processes and
water resources and their response to changes in the
environment, such as the increase in greenhouse gases. GEWEX
will provide an order of magnitude improvement in the ability to
model global precipitation and evaporation as well as accurate
assessment of the sensitivity of atmospheric radiation and
clouds to climate change.

Objectives of the GEWEX Program:

1. Determine the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes by means
of global measurements of atmospheric and surface properties.
2. Model the global hydrological cycle and its impact on the
atmosphere, oceans and land surfaces.
3. Develop the ability to predict the variations of global and
regional hydrological processes and water resources, and their response
to environmental change.
4. Advance the development of observing techniques, data management,
and assimiliation systems for operational application to long-range
weather forecasts, hydrology, and climate predictions.

GEWEX Program Strategy:
1. Build on existing programs and data.

2. Conduct modeling programs to model all aspects of the
   hydrologic and energy cycles with evolving fully coupled
   atmosphere-land-ocean components.

3. Make recommendations to space agencies with respect to instruments
   planned for satellite platforms.

4. Conduct pilot studies with international participation
   encompassing the full range of experimental scales:

   small scale
   continental scale
   global scale

With regard to fisheries disputes concerning the interpretation or application of Convention provisions, they are to be settled by a binding form of dispute settlement.

The issues under this exception include the coastal state's discretionary powers for determining allowable catch, its harvesting capacity, the allocation of surpluses to other states and the terms and conditions established in its conservation and management laws and regulations.

However, a coastal state would be obliged to submit to conciliation certain specific disputes - those arising from an allegation that:

(i) a coastal state has manifestly failed to comply with its obligations to ensure through proper conservation and management measures that the maintenance of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone is not seriously endangered;
(ii) a coastal state has arbitrarily refused to determine, at the request of another state, the allowable catch and its capacity to harvest living resources with respect to stocks which that other state is interested in fishing; or

(iii) a coastal state has arbitrarily refused to allocate to any state, under Articles 62, 69 and 70 and under the terms and conditions established by the coastal state consistent with the Convention, the whole or part of the surplus it has declared to exist.

NACP Project Profile http://www.nacarbon.org/cgi-nacp/web/investigations/inv_pgp.pl?pgid=305

The main hypothesis of the proposed research is that ecosystem respiration is a major determinant of annual net ecosystem carbon exchange and global warming potential, and their interannual variability, for maize and soybean agroecosystems in the Great Plains region. 
The research will determine annual ecosystem respiration and global warming potential (and their associated interannual variability) for major agroecosystems in the Great Plains region through the acquisition of unique datasets on continuous, year round measurements of soil surface trace gas fluxes using a series of autochambers. We will couple the surface CO2 fluxes with continuous estimates of aboveground plant respiration in order to provide annually integrated estimates of ecosystem respiration. We will also determine annual global warming potentials in the selected agroecosystems using the continuous measurements of surface N2O and CH4 fluxes. In addition, we will obtain information on biophysical and physiological controlling factors governing spatial and temporal variability in surface gas fluxes, ecosystem respiration and global warming potentials in these systems. 

The research will increase our understanding of the basic physical and biological processes controlling surface-atmosphere exchange of energy-related greenhouse gases in the context of major agricultural land management systems in the United States. The following information will be obtained for major agroecosystems in the Great Plains region: (1) annual ecosystem respiration and global warming potential and their associated interannual variability in these cropping systems at the field scale, (2) information on biophysical and physiological controlling factors which help explain the variability in ecosystem respiration and global warming potential, and (3) unique datasets on continuous, year round measurements of soil surface CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes, depth profiles of trace gas concentrations and relevant supporting variables in the selected agroecosystems.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Project Origination
To accomplish the objectives of CASERTZ, we partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey to develop a Twin Otter aerogeophysical platform that succeeded in integrating, ice-penetrating radar, laser altimetry, gravity and magnetic instrumentation for simultaneous operation. In 1994, in response to the science proposal to complete the CASERTZ corridors, the National Science Foundation&amp;#039;s Office of Polar Programs requested that the aircraft and its integrated instrumentation package be operated as a facility with a mission of providing aerogeophysical observations to the broader Antarctic science community. This request led to a Cooperative Agreement between UTIG and NSF that created the Support Office for Aerogeophysical Research (SOAR).
The SOAR Mission
The six-year Cooperative Agreement defined UTIG&amp;#039;s responsibilities as:


-Assisting in the development of aerogeophysical research projects with NSF/OPP investigators

-Upgrading the CASERTZ instrumentation package to accommodate new science projects and advances in technology;  fielding this instrument package to accomplish SOAR developed projects

-Distribution of the acquired aerogeophysical data as spatially organized transects to the Project Investigators within six months of its return from the field.

An option was included for SOAR to reduce and analyze the aerogeophysical data that it collected for members of the scientific community without that capacity.

SOAR Accomplishments
Beginning in 1994, UTIG conducted aerogeophysical surveys in seven consecutive Antarctic field seasons. These SOAR-developed surveys were performed for the 20 investigators and 14 institutions listed in Table 1. The first six of these seasons were managed under the NSF/UTIG Cooperative Agreement with D. Blankenship as PI; the last, 2000/2001, was managed as a multi-investigator grant to UTIG with D. Blankenship, J. Holt, D. Morse and I. Dalziel as co PI&amp;#039;s. To accomplish these surveys, UTIG configured the integrated instrumentation package and installed it in the aircraft on site in Antarctica each season; additionally, base camp operations were established at up to five remote sites each field season. In total, UTIG conducted an additional 225,000 line kilometers of aerogeophysical surveys in 422 flights covering the areas shown in the Figure. The spatially organized database of geophysical transects was delivered to the various investigators within the targeted six-month time frame.

of a comprehensive modeling system.  The second objective
involves scaling the climate model output to make it useful for

between hydrologic predictions and water resources management,
including the use of demonstration projects, and better
understanding of the effects of land surface changes on the
regional hydrology.  Two major new initiatives will be the

The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) is an Explorer mission
that was managed by the Office of Space Science Mission and
Payload Development Division of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA).

The Earth is constantly bombarded with a stream of accelerated
particles arriving not only from the Sun, but also from
interstellar and galactic sources. Study of these energetic
particles will contribute to our understanding of the formation
and evolution of the solar system as well as the astrophysical
processes involved. The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
spacecraft carrying six high-resolution sensors and three
monitoring instruments samples low-energy particles of solar
origin and high-energy galactic particles with a collecting
power 10 to 1000 times greater than past or planned experiments.

From a vantage point approximately 1/100 of the distance from
the Earth to the Sun ACE performs measurements over a wide range
of energy and nuclear mass, under all solar wind flow conditions
and during both large and small particle events including solar
flares. ACE provides near-real-time solar wind information over
short time periods. When reporting space weather ACE can provide
an advance warning (about one hour) of geomagnetic storms that
can overload power grids, disrupt communications on Earth, and
present a hazard to astronauts.

ACE orbits the L1 libration point which is a point of Earth-Sun
gravitational equilibrium about 1.5 million km from Earth and
148.5 million km from the Sun. With a semi-major axis of
approximately 200,000 km the elliptical orbit affords ACE a
prime view of the Sun and the galactic regions beyond.

Project URL: http://www.ipyyouth.org/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=168
The International Polar Year YSC (IPY YSC) is being proposed to ensure that IPY's goals to include the next generation of polar researchers and the world's youth are met. 

The IPY YSC would be made up of young representatives from around the world. They would be responsible for being the link from their home countries national YSC's to the IPY YSC as well as working on international initiatives. The concept for national level YSC's would be based on the successful model already developed in Canada and approved by Canada's IPY Steering Committee. The national YSC represents youth engaged in all forms of research within a country from science to social science as well as youth with indigenous and arts backgrounds. Youth from all levels of education (from high school through to the post-doc stage) would work together to bring IPY to the youth of that country. Each regional committee would be responsible for outreach within their country while the IPY YSC as a whole would undertake projects such as: providing a link to enhance international collaborations between young leaders and researchers, mentorship programs between youth and IPY researchers, getting youth involved in IPY programs, providing a webpage resource where interested parties could find out more about polar opportunities, encouraging a stronger focus on polar regions and the issues facing these areas and working to build a crucial bridge between the often disjointed Arctic and Antarctic researchers.

The IPY YSC would go beyond the goals of individual national YSC's and focus on projects more global in scope such as:

 An International Youth Conference on the Poles (IYCP) that would take place during IPY (proposed for late August, 2008). This would bring together youth from a diverse set of backgrounds and nationalities to discuss the current issues facing our polar regions and their effects on the remainder of the planet, ways of addressing these issues and highlighting ongoing IPY research, especially research being undertaken by youth. Included within the conference would be break out sessions where youth could form policy recommendations, which would be brought forward to international bodies such as UNESCO, SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) and the Arctic Council. UNESCO has expressed interest in providing facilities for this conference.

-In collaboration with International Heliophysical Year (IHY)-IPY's IGY-Gold Program, connecting youth to the previous generations of polar researchers. Youth would interview IGY participants for a fresh perspective on their experiences and develop these interviews into documentary or book form. 

-Establish an International YSC website focused on how to get youth involved. Include an education centre where youth can educate themselves about polar issues and then download materials to educate their peers and communities. The website would provide information on how youth can get directly involved in IPY projects (i.e. as graduate students, field assistants, volunteers, guest lecturers etc) and also provide guidance on how to get involved with the IPY YSC or how to form their own national committees.

-Document youth opinions on what the legacy of IPY should be. This list would ultimately serve to check the progress of IPY as it continues to develop and at the conclusion of IPY in 2009 to help judge how successful the program has been.

- A youth mentorship program in association with the Youth Science Foundation Canada (YSF). This would build on YSF's existing peer to peer mentoring program for high school aged youth, SMARTS (Student Mentorship Association Regarding Technology &amp; Science). IPY YSC would aid YSF in extending this program first to include university level students and ultimately senior researchers and university professors. IPY YSC would also work to bring more polar expertise into this program.

-Connect youth to the poles and to each other. Reach out to the youth of late high school to early college age who have not yet chosen, or, more importantly, have long ago decided against, science as career, including that large group of youth who worry about the planet but whom often dismiss science as irrelevant, unreliable, arrogant, useless. Act as a strong voice on polar issues. Utilize marketing strategies aimed at our generation to vocalize support for IPY. Connect internationally to members of our generation who are not currently aware of the many concerns and issues facing the poles and the impacts changes there will have on their lives. Build connections that would help erode the divide between research science and science education.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=120

The Arctic is a region characterized by the presence of sea-ice, glaciers and permafrost. By its nature, it is particular sensitive to climatic change. The last decennia of the 20th century have seen a rapid increase in mean temperatures, melting of glaciers, decrease of Arctic sea-ice coverage and thawing of permafrost areas. Continued warming will undoubtedly have strong consequences, not only for the arctic communities, but for the world as a whole. The climatic history of the past two millenia with a (warm) Roman Period, (cold) Dark Ages, (warm) Medieval Optimum, (cold) Little Ice Age and 20th Century Warming shows that rapid shifts in the natural climate regime have occurred repeatedly. There are strong indications that these climate trends are not uni-directional for the entire Arctic, but that they show regional patterns, e.g. the recent contrast between SW Greenland cooling and NW European warming. Previously, sea surface temperatures offshore SW Greenland had been relatively high during the 1950's and 1960's, when northwest European winters were generally more severe (e.g. 1962-63). Consequently, it is likely that for a given time interval patterns of human occupation and activities may also regionally have been different. prehistorical times, around 2000 years ago, the Dorset (Innuit) Culture was about to disappear in Greenland, whereas it took several centuries before a new Innuit culture immigrated. In a historical context it includes the period during which the Vikings settled on the Faroer, Iceland and Greenland and also travelled to Newfoundland. The second part of the last millennium were the heydays for dutch whaling expeditions. The latter implies that a wealth of historical data (ship's logbooks) on climatic and sea ice conditions are available.

Notable is the shift of whaling activities from Spitsbergen to Davis Strait during the later part of the Little Ice Age, a well known cooling period in NW Europe.

Arctic archeology is about human adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Critical boundary conditions for human survival in the Arctic, such as duration of the summer season, permafrost conditions and the presence of sea-ice are often difficult to establish based on archeological evidence alone. Research has its specific logistic problems: short seasons, permafrost, ice/snow coverage, resulting in an often scattered and fragmented archeological record. To complete this record, a consistent chronological climatic/environmental context is needed. This can be supplied by paleoclimatological research, aiming to reconstruct climatic/environmental variability at high resolution. This is achieved by analysing sedimentological (grainsize, composition), chemical (geochemistry, stable oxygen and carbon isotopes) and biological (foraminifera, diatoms, molluscs) parameters from marine/terrestrial cores and environments taken in key areas.

NORCLIM (IPY 120) is designed to provide constraints on pressing questions that address the nature of the 20th century Arctic warming. The proposal focusses on natural climate variability during the past 2000 years with special emphasis on the permafrost/sea-ice relation and on contrasting climatic trends (south)west off Greenland when compared with the NE Atlantic region.

The research is based on an integrated approach to reconstruct the changes in ocean surface currents, particularly the inflow of warm Atlantic water versus outflow of ice-loaded Polar water, terrestrial environments and evolution of glaciers and ice sheets in the study area. Evidence for climatic variability will be gathered from marine/terrestrial sedimentary records (multiproxy approach), molluscs, geomorphological and archeological evidence, and historical archives (e.g. whaling data).

The objectives of NORCLIM are:
- To correlate existing marine/terrestrial paleoclimate records
- To link existing marine/terrestrial paleoclimate records with archeological/historical information
- To identify gaps in our knowledge for the various key-areas
- To fill these gaps by collecting additional information onshore and offshore for all data sets
- To place archeological and historical data in a solid climatological framework
- To use the confirmed regional contrasts, if any, for improved regional climate prediction and societal/economic planning.

Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are continually improving in their ability to simulate the major features of today´s climate. Many of these models are being used to predict future climate change and although there is broad agreement among the models, there are also many differences in the details of their predictions. In order to determine whether models can simulate climatic conditions much different from today, the models can be used to simulate paleoclimates, and paleodata can be used to evaluate the results. Moreover, AGCMs have proved their usefulness to investigate mechanisms of past climate changes (e.g., Joussaume, 1999)). The Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) was initiated in order to coordinate and encourage the systematic study of AGCMs and to assess their ability to simulate large changes of climate such as those that occurred in the distant past. It also is serving to encourage the preparation of global reconstructions of paleoclimates that can be used to evaluate climate models.

The PMIP effort developed out of a NATO Advanced Research Workshop, convened in 1991, which led to a cooperative and coordinated effort to compare model simulations with paleoclimate data. The workshop participants agreed to focus initially on two specific periods in the past : the last glacial maximum, 21 000 years before present (BP), and the mid-Holocene climate, 6 000 years BP, which correspond to extreme conditions that are relatively well documented. Simulating the last glacial maximum provides an opportunity for assessing the models´ ability to simulate extreme cold conditions as well as for studying the feedbacks associated with both a decrease of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and ice sheet elevation of 2 to 3 km above North America and northern Europe. The simulation of the mid-Holocene conditions is on the other hand a sensitivity experiment in which the seasonal contrast of incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere is changed; 6000 years BP, the seasonal contrast was larger in the northern summer, leading to an increase of summer monsoons over Africa and South Asia.

Future changes in stratospheric humidity and ozone concentration in response to changing climate are significant climate feedbacks. While the tropospheric water vapor climate feedback is well represented in global models, predictions of future changes in stratospheric humidity are highly uncertain because of gaps in our understanding of physical processes occurring in the region of the atmosphere that controls the composition of the stratosphere, the Tropical Tropopause Layer. Uncertainties in the Tropical Tropopause Layer region’s chemical composition also limit our ability to predict future changes in stratospheric ozone. By improving our understanding of the processes that control how much water vapor gets into this region from lower in the atmosphere, the ATTREX investigation will directly address these uncertainties in our knowledge of the climate system.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">READER (REference Antarctic Data for Environmental Research) is a project of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR http://www.scar.org/) and has the goal of creating a high quality, long term dataset of mean surface and upper air meteorological measurements from in-situ Antarctic observing systems. These data will be of value in climate research and climate change investigations.

The primary sources of data are the Antarctic research stations and automatic weather stations. Data from mobile platforms, such as ships and drifting buoys are not being collected since our goal is to derive time series of data at fixed locations.

Surface and upper air data are being collected and the principal statistics derived are monthly and annual means. Daily data will not be provided in order to keep the data set to a manageable size. With the resources available to the project, it is clearly not possible to collect all the information that could be required by the whole range of investigations into change in the Antarctic. Instead a key set of meteorological variables (surface temperature, mean sea level pressure and surface wind speed, and upper air temperature, geopotential height and wind speed at standard levels) are being assembled and a definitive set of measurements presented for use by researchers.

A lot of stations have been operated in the Antarctic over the years; many for quite short periods. However, our goal here is to provide information on the long time series that can provide insight into change in the Antarctic. So to be included, the record from a station must extend for 25 years, although not necessarily in a continuous period, or be currently in operation and have operated for the last 10 years. In READER we have chosen to use only data from year-round stations.

It is important when using mean data to know the number of observations that were used in computing the means. As discussed in the data section, the READER mean monthly values are therefore colour coded to indicate the percentage of possible observations used in computing each mean.

The READER data set is being disseminated via CD-ROM and through the World Wide Web at http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/programs-hosted.html. The first release of the data set covers the period up to the end of 2000 and contains all the data collected so far. However, there are still a number of significant gaps and it is hoped that these can be filled over the coming years. In particular, we still require more upper air data.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Observations of Persistent Upwelling Structures</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A significant proportion of global primary production occurs in the coastal ocean where the biological pump exports carbon to deep water. The pump's efficiency depends on the fraction of carbon fixation that escapes recycling within the mixed layer, i.e. new production, which is supported by nutrient influx (e.g. nitrate or silicate) to the euphotic zone. Wind-driven coastal upwelling provides nutrient enrichment that creates high rates of new production in eastern boundary ocean margins, which will be described here using historical data collected by our group in a variety of upwelling areas. These include data from Peru, northwest Africa and Baja, California collected during the 1970's as part of the Coastal Upwelling Ecosystem Analysis (CUEA) Program, in the 1980's at Point Conception, CA during the Organization of Persistent Upwelling Structures (OPUS) Project, in the 1990's in Monterey Bay, CA and more recently off Bodega Bay California during the Coastal Ocean Processes Wind Events and Shelf Transport (CoOP-WEST) program. In all studies, the percent of new production or "f ratio" was calculated using the same approach, from nitrate uptake measured using the stable isotopic tracer, 15N. A common feature in these systems, is the need for a brief window of relaxed winds (3-5 days) following an upwelling event, to enable new production rates to increase, as phytoplankton biomass accumulates. More recently, the importance of the larger sized fraction of phytoplankton (mainly diatoms) to new production in these ecosystems has been documented. The significance of this diatom dominance to carbon flux and sinking export within these productive coastal ecosystems will be discussed.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">ARCTIC OCEAN BIODIVERSITY</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Arctic Ocean is unique on Earth in its physical and biological properties. It is the most extreme ocean in regard to the seasonality of light and its year-round existing ice cover. Current knowledge indicates that the Arctic seas hold a multitude of unique life forms highly adapted in their life history, ecology and physiology to the extreme and seasonal conditions of their environment. Our knowledge of what currently lives in the Arctic Ocean is still rudimentary compared to most other regions, due to the logistical challenges imposed by its multiyear ice and inhospitable climate. 

The Arctic Ocean is also the area where the impact of climate change might be strongest expressed. The already on-going changes make the effort to identify the diversity of life in the major three realms (sea ice, water column and sea floor) an urgent issue. Changes in the environmental conditions will have direct effects on the marine biota on multiple scales, from communities and populations to individuals. Species level information is, therefore, essential to discussions on climate change or anthropogenic impact, their expressions and effects. These effects can only be detected through long-term monitoring of key species, communities and processes. For monitoring and assessment of changes, the availability of baseline data is crucial.

The Census of Marine Life is implementing a project aimed at documenting the present Arctic Ocean Biodiversity (PDF download) using an international Pan-Arctic view. The operational approach is for coordinated research efforts, designed to examine the diversity in each of the major three realms: sea ice, water column and sea floor. This program will consolidate what is known and fill remaining gaps in our knowledge: it aims for active participation in the International Polar Year 2007/2008. ArcOD was listed as lead for the Arctic Ocean diversity cluster by ICSU. Most recent research efforts in the Arctic Ocean focus on processes. The emphasis of this program is on biodiversity, because processes are critically impacted by the composition of biota involved in them.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

Scientific Objectives:
     Growing concerns with effects of climatic anomalies have brought the
realization that climate itself is dynamic and that observations from the
oceans require the same detailed study that has been devoted to observation
from stations on land for over a century.
     These considerations formed the starting point for the construction of a
Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS).  Development of COADS is a
continuing cooperative effort between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), its Environmental Research Laboratories, National
Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and Cooperative Institute for Research in
Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and the National Science Foundation's National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  Initiated in 1981, the COADS project
has used modern formats to minimize storage volume and other innovations in
data organization to provide for the first-time convenient and efficient
access to a unique record of ocean-atmosphere behavior, beginning in 1854 and
continuing into the future.
Project Description:
     Global marine data observed during 1854-1979, primarily by
ships-of-opportunity, have been collected, edited, and summarized
statistically for each month of each year of the period, using 2 degree
latitude times 2 degree longitude boxes.  Products now available in a first
release from this Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set include full
quality-controlled (trimmed) reports and summaries.  Each of the 70 million
unique reports contains 28 elements of weather, position, etc., as well as
flags indicating which observations were statistically trimmed.  The
summaries give 14 statistics, such as the median and mean, for each of eight
observed variables of air and sea surface temperatures, wind, pressure,
humidity, and cloudiness, plus 11 derived variables.  Relatively noisy
(untrimmed) individual reports and summaries (giving 14 statistics for each of
the eight observed variables) are available for investigators who prefer their
own quality control.  Two other report forms, inventories, and decade-month
summaries are among the other data products available.  FORTRAN 77 software
available to help read 'packed binary' data products and processing details,
such as the method of identifying duplicate reports, are also described.
Data Products:
     COADS products currently available from NCAR or NCDC are listed in the
following table.  Product numbers correspond to Release 1 (gaps in numbering
refer to earlier versions of available products that are no longer supported).
Type of product is indicated by R (individual marine reports), M (2 degrees
year-month summaries), D (2 degrees decade-month summaries), or -- (other).
The number of tapes is based on a tape density of 6250 characters/inch.
Footnotes to commonly selected products give some additional details (minor
products may later be reviewed for retention).  All tapes are available
through NCAR, except product number 19, which is available through NCDC.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">International Partnerships in Ice Core Science (IPICS)-International Polar Year Initiative</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Ice cores have contributed substantially to understanding climate change. They provide convincing evidence of large, abrupt climate changes, demonstrate links between greenhouse gases and climate, and show how humans have altered the atmosphere. However, there is a great deal more to learn. In 2004, representatives of all major ice coring nations agreed on a common agenda for the next decade. This agenda looks beyond established projects and includes coring over all available timescales, with highest feasible resolution. IPY provides an opportunity to launch this initiative. Other ice coring efforts, including some that are part of International Partnerships in Ice Coring (IPICS), are the subject of separate IPY submissions, as indicated below. IPICS-related events planned for IPY include:

1. Searching for the longest possible ice core record. The oldest Antarctic ice core so far extends 800-900 kyr. Before this, Earth's climate had a 40 kyr glacial-interglacial periodicity. IPICS aims to find a 1.2 Myr record and help discover why the period changed. During IPY, initial survey work will occur as part of the TASTE-IDEA ice divides traverses, by French/Italian/Russian teams in the Dome C-North Vostok-Dome B region, by a Chinese team near Dome A, and by US-led radar and remote sensing teams. IPICS will collate results to recommend drilling sites.
2. Initiation of coring to recover the last interglacial and older ice from Greenland. The last interglacial was probably warmer than the present and is an analogue for an anthropogenically-warmed world. We need to learn about the behaviour of climate and the Greenland ice sheet during times of warmer climate. The oldest reliable core only partly penetrates the last interglacial. Drilling in northwest Greenland would start, and possibly finish, in IPY. Danish, US, French, Japanese, UK, Swiss, Swedish, and German groups have expressed interest, and others are expected to join. Note that while this effort is part of the IPICS agenda, it also falls under IPY lead project # 561 (Greenland’s Ice Sheet – reactions to past and present climate change), which will lead IPY efforts related to this element of IPICS.
3. Starting a detailed spatial network of deep and intermediate-depth Antarctic ice cores. The spatial pattern of change is key to climate dynamics. We have cores from central East Antarctica and from a few coastal regions, but additional data are needed from other key areas, including the northern part of Lake Vostok, coastal Antarctica, the Antarctic peninsula, and West Antarctica. New projects like the European drilling at Talos Dome (east Antarctica) will take place during IPY. These programs will provide a springboard for a larger effort to fully sample Antarctic spatial climate variability on all possible time scales.
5. The WAIS Divide Ice Core. This West Antarctic ice core will produce the best climate record covering the past 100,000 years, including highly resolved histories of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and millennial and shorter time-scale climate change in Antarctica. The main drilling starts during IPY, in the 2007/2008 Antarctic field season.
4. Late Holocene climate change. Future change can only be assessed in the context of natural climate variability. Highly resolved compilations of past global climate (timescale up to 2000 years) critically lack polar data. The SCAR project, ITASE, produced 250 cores that cover the last 250 years. Extending this time scale to the last millennium, and expanding the scope in the Arctic, are critical. IPY will engage all countries to complete work in Antarctica and continue the effort in the Arctic.
6. SOFIA (Search for the Oldest Firn Interstitial Air). SOFIA aims to obtain firn air records spanning more than the last 150 years, encompassing much of the period from the industrial revolution to the present day. Large firn air samples are critical for understanding this period of atmospheric history as they allow measurements (of trace species or isotopic ratios) that are otherwise impossible with ice core samples.

Contaminants have been detected both in the Antarctic Ecosystem (AAE) and in the Arctic Ecosystem (AE). It has been illustrated that in Polar Regions, concentrations of some semi-volatile contaminants may become elevated due to the cold-condensation effect. Global warming is also expected to alter contaminant dynamics and fate in polar regions although the magnitude and nature of these effects is difficult to predict. Because many of these contaminants, like organochlorines, exhibit toxicity and are persistent, they pose a risk to organisms that reside in Polar Regions. For the AE this has been shown, see for instance the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) in which some partners of the current consortium participated. For an assessment of the extent of contamination in the Polar Regions, and associated risks, information is needed on routes of transport to Polar Regions, fate of contaminants in Polar Regions and food web uptake and levels in biota, preferably combined with spatial and temporal trends. This EoI is a combined effort in order to assess this in a multi-disciplinary way, in an international consortium, focused on both Polar Regions. Within the EoI two research pillars are defined: 1) on the transport and fate of contaminants to and in Polar Regions, 2) on the food web transfer and contaminant status of higher organisms. 

Research pillar 1: atmospheric transport, deposition and photochemistry à input to Polar Regions
In order to address the occurrence and routes of transport to Polar Regions, an international circumpolar network will be established to document contaminant deposition to terrestrial Arctic/Antarctic environments, using the moss/lichen monitoring approach and snow-sampling approaches coupled with passive POPs samplers. This network will build upon passive sampling devices in co-operation with the Global Atmospheric Passive Sampling (GAPS) Project, but also on in situ passive biomonitors (lichens and mosses). It builds on the work of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) in advancing our understanding of spatial patterns of contaminant deposition in the Arctic, and adds an Antarctic module. It is linked to other IPY EoI&amp;#039;s and full proposals like OASIS, GOA and ATMOPOL. The work will fill knowledge gaps defined by successful ongoing Arctic programs (Northern Contaminants Program and Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) and contribute to development and validation of models used to predict contaminant transport and deposition.

Research pillar 2: food web transfer and risks
The focus of this initiative will be to document recent trends and derive conclusions on the nature of contaminant biotransport through diverse trophic level pathways of polar food web and to compare/contrast contaminant distributions and bioaccumulation for Antarctic and Arctic food webs. Integrated bipolar research, using similar methods, will be highly beneficial to both regions. The AAE has very little anthropogenic influence and may therefore act as reference for the AE, while for AE more toxicity data is available, which may be extrapolated to the Antarctic region. The following topics will be addressed: trophic magnification factors for predator-prey species in AAE and AE (food web transfer to birds and mammals, including ringed seals in the AE), comparison of compound patterns and levels in Antarctica with the Arctic, spatial and temporal trends between and within AAE and AE, emerging contaminants and toxicity assessment at lower trophic levels, especially for Antarctic species. Contaminants in combination with dietary descriptors (for instance stable isotopes) will be used as ecological markers to enhance the understanding of the polar marine food web and trophic relations, which account for the elevated level of contaminants at higher trophic levels. For the AAE, specific attention will be drawn to the role of stations in the local contamination of the environment.
The research will be designed such that the overall outcome of the project will be an integrated picture of new knowledge on routes and mode of transport to Polar Regions, and uptake and food web transfer in Polar Ecosystems. Integration of Arctic and Antarctic data will enable comparisons between the regions, but will also use the specific values of the data of the two regions (Antarctica being perhaps a better reference site, Arctic region with more toxicity data).

Without interruption since 1956, Americans have been studying the
Antarctic and its interactions with the rest of the planet. These
investigators and supporting personnel make up the U.S. Antarctic
Program, which carries forward the Nation's goals of supporting the
Antarctic Treaty, fostering cooperative research with other nations,
protecting the Antarctic environment, and developing measures to
ensure only equitable and wise use of resources. The program comprises
research by scientists selected from universities and other research
institutions and operations and support by a contractor and the Navy,
the Air National Guard, the Air Force, the Army, and the Cold Regions
Research and Engineering Laboratory of the Army. The National Science
Foundation (the U.S. Government agency that promotes the progress of
science) funds and manages the program. Approximately, 3,000 Americans
are involved each year.

The research has three goals: to understand the region and its
ecosystems; to understand its effects on (and responses to) global
processes such as climate; and to use the region as a platform to
study the upper atmosphere and space. Antarctica's remoteness and
extreme climate make field science more expensive than in most
places. Research is done in the Antarctic only when it cannot be
performed at more convenient locations.

The program has three year-round research stations. In summer (the
period of extensive sunlight and comparative warmth that lasts roughly
October through February) additional camps are established for
glaciologists, earth scientists, biologists, and others. Large,
ski-equipped LC-130 airplanes, which only the United States has,
provide air logistics. Air National Guard crews operate these
planes. Helicopters, flown by a contractor, provide close support for
many research teams. Tracked or wheeled vehicles provide transport
over land and snow; small boats are used in coastal areas.

Near-Earth space (geospace) is an integral part of the Earth system, providing the material link between the Sun and Earth, primarily through the polar regions. A goal of the ICESTAR Programme is to create an integrated, quantitative description of the upper atmosphere over Antarctica, and its coupling to the geospace environment.

Thematic Action Groups (TAGs) were established to coordinate the scientific activities and objectives proposed:

* TAG A: Quantification of the coupling between the polar ionosphere and neutral atmosphere from the "bottom-to-top" and the global electric circuit.
*TAG B: Quantification of the inner magnetospheric dynamics using remote sensing techniques.
*TAG C: Quantification of the state of the upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere over the Antarctic continent and how it differs from the Northern hemisphere during a wide range of geophysical conditions.
* TAG C.1: Quantify the atmospheric consequences of the global electric circuit and further understand the electric circuit in the middle atmosphere as guided by the electric fields generated at the solar wind magnetosphere interface. Contact: Nikolai Østgaard (University of Bergen, Norway)
*TAG C.2: Quantify the thermal and dynamical structure of the middle and upper atmosphere over the Antarctic continent and how it differs from the Northern hemisphere during a wide range of geophysical conditions. Contact: Scott Palo (University of Colorado, USA).

The VENTS Program, established in 1984, conducts research on the
oceanic impacts and consequences of submarine volcanoes and
hydrothermal venting. The program focuses on understanding the
chemical and thermal effects of venting along the northeast Pacific
Ocean seafloor spreading centers, which provides the foundation for
prediction of the global-scale impact of seafloor hydrothermal systems
on the ocean.

VENTS research in recent years has concentrated on,
determining patterns and pathways for the regional transport of
hydrothermal emissions, as well as source strengths of the emissions,
and their relationships to the geology and tectonics of spreading
centers, and further developing capabilities for monitoring
hydrothermal activity at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.
Research results continue to augment the case for hydrothermal venting
at seafloor spreading centers having global significance in terms of
the chemical and thermal state of the ocean. Researchers continue to
document quantitatively these effects as they occur in the ocean over
a very wide range of temporal and spatial scales.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The objective of this project is to analyze the effect that the incident UV
radiation has on the Antarctic bacterial flora. Two different systems will be
studied:

a) Effect on coastal marine bacteria. We will continue with experimental assays
using interferential filters in order to infer the effects of the different
wavelength bands ... (PAR, UV-A y UV-B) on the viability of the predominant
bacterial strains of the coastal marine ecosystem as well as on the bacterial
community as a whole. Assays at different deeps using the water column as a
natural UV filter will be performed. These studies will be made not only using
fixed systems but using dynamic systems too, in order to simulate the natural
vertical circulation of the water masses and the microorganisms living in such
water masses. The field studies will be complemented and compared with
laboratory assays where the bacterial isolates will be maintained under
different irradiation regimes. In all cases, bacterial viability will be
evaluated by viable counts. In addition, generation of oxygen-reactive species
will be analyzed.

b) Effect on the soil bacteria associated to Antarctic plants. It is well known
that the UV radiation induces on the vegetation a number of responses including
production of flavonoids and other UV-screen pigments. Since some authors have
reported that these compounds have biocide activity, an excess of UV radiation
could be affecting indirectly the Antarctic soils bacterial communities through
their action on the scarce vegetation. The objective of this part of the
project is to study the populations of Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus
quitensis in the surrounding of Jubany Station, Antarctica and to analyze if
their response to UV radiation are related to the dynamics of bacterial
communities associated to their structures.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Deep Ocean Gas Exchange Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The rates at which gases exchange between the oceans and the atmosphere are extremely important to global biogeochemical cycles and to predicting and modelling future climate change, but quantifying them accurately currently remains elusive. Some important issues requiring accurate such estimates include the rate at which anthropogenic carbon dioxide can be taken up by the oceans, quantifying the marine sources of other important atmospheric greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, and investigating the roles of other marine derived atmospheric gases in a range of climate and atmospheric chemistry related issues. Although advances have been made in our understanding of the gas exchange process in recent years, these advances are still not sufficient to enable us to understand and predict the effects of the major controlling processes. A major problem in the past has been that individual controlling processes have tended to be addressed in isolation, although it is clear that they are all interconnected. What is now required in order to build on past advances is a fully integrated study of the problem using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques. We will achieve this aim by bringing together for the first time, a team of UK experts with diverse interests and expertise within the field of air-sea gas exchange, but with the common goal of understanding these processes more fully. The UK SOLAS directed programme is an ideal framework within which to do this. We plan to participate in two research cruises in the North Atlantic Ocean, during which we will make a variety of key measurements and observations (measure seastate, whitecapping and wave breaking, evaluate the role of bubbles and surfactants in gas transfer, and employ a combination of direct gas flux measurement techniques for CO2, DMS, halocarbons and other gases), supported by a suite of ancillary water column and meteorological data. Our overarching strategy is to constrain these various measurements within an experiment in which we will release gaseous tracers to the water column. By measuring the rates at which these tracers escape to air we will derive important information on gas exchange rates that will provide a framework for interpreting our other measurements. Our cruises will be timed to coincide with times of maximum air-sea exchange fluxes of climatically relevant trace gases. During one of these we will release a natural surfactant along with the gaseous tracers, in order tto investigate the role of surface organic slicks, which are known to suppress air-sea gas exchange. We also anticipate the participation of a number of US-based groups with aims and measurement capabilities complimentary to our own, which will bring "added value" to the programme. However these are conditional upon external funding from NSF and other US government funding agencies.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=109

The aim of the proposed project is to test the model that the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS) is a horse tail structure due to movement of the Marie Byrd Land microplate / Thurston Island block away from Victoria Land to the NE (by 400 km in 100 Ma) (Behrendt and Cooper 1991, Luyendyk et al. 1996). While it is developed as extensional pull apart basin in the Ross Sea embayment it is proposed here that it is expressed as dextral strike slip fault system at its northeastern end in remote Ellsworth land.

Ross Sea embayment as well as Marie Byrd Land and its volcanics were studied in great detail over decades (Behrendt et al. 1991, Behrendt 1999, LeMasurier 1972, 1990, 2002, Rocchi et al. 2002). Only during the 1990s investigations of the subglacial geology were performed in restricted areas within the central WARS of the Subglacial Byrd Basin by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Airborne Gravimetry Initiative, e. g. in the CASERTZ quadrangle as well as in the area of Ice Stream D draining into the Ross Ice Shelf (Behrendt et al. 1994, 1998, Bell et al. 1998, Blankenship et al. 1993). Additional information was gathered by more recent initiatives like the ANUBIS broadband seismic experiment (Winberry and Anandakrishnan 2004). 

The results of multi-disciplinary aerogeophysical surveys - that must be addressed as restricted with respect to the continental dimensions of the rift system - indicate that the southern boundary fault of WARS extends north of Whitmore Mts. towards Ellsworth Mts. (EWM) while a northern boundary fault cannot be identified clearly. The sedimentary basin with extensional horst and graben structures extends well into the Subglacial Byrd Basin and the basin is associated with active seismicity and volcanism, subglacial caldera structures indicate voluminous magmatic systems within upper crustal levels. 

In order to test the model investigations are needed in Ellsworth Land, one of the least accessible and most poorly known areas in Antarctica. It stretches between Amundsen Sea, Ronne Ice Shelf and Bellingshausen Sea and encloses a triangle (see map) between Hudson Mts. at the Walgreen Coast, Sentinel Range in the Ellsworth Mountains and Eltanin Bay with the Rydberg Peninsula at the Bryan Coast. The focus of the research activities is a multi-disciplinary aerogeophysical survey within this triangle, including imaging of subglacial topography as well as the magnetic and gravity field.

Ground based geoscience fieldwork studies include: structural geology studies to check for indications of the regional stress field at the northern end of the Ellsworth Mts. (EWM); seismic study with temporary broadband seismic stations; GPS measurements in the Hudson Mountains (e.g. on Webber Nunatak), at Eltanin Bay (altern. Mt. Tuve) as well as at the northern end of the Sentinel Range (e.g. Mt. Weems);
sampling for fission track dating to describe the exhumation history of individual geodynamic blocks as well as sampling for paleomagnetic studies in order to reconstruct paleopositions mapping and dating of hydroclastic eruptive features within the Bellingshausen Volcanic Provinc from Hudson Mts. in the West over Jones Mts. to Rydberg Peninsula at Bryan Coast in the East in order to deceiver ice sheet dynamics by reconstructing thicknesses of paleo-ice sheets; geo- and mineralchemistry of volcanics and enclosed mantle and crustal xenoliths in order to describe variations in magma genesis including mantle source compositions, mantle melting regimes and differentiation during ascent through the lithosphere; additional fastdrilling might provide sampling of the subglacial geology

The project of the IDs 107, 895, 276 and the ANTEC activities of Reinhard Dietrich will be initiated within the framework of the German mission to Pine Island Bay in the season 2005/06 (02-04/2006) by setting up a GPS reference point within the Hudson Mountains at Pine Island Bay as well as by initial volcanological and petrological field studies including sampling and dating the volcanic structures and their exposure ages as well as identifying the point of an eruption recorded by satellites in the Hudson Mountain Volcanic Field in 1985, which is the closest to the fastest flowing glacier in Antarctica, the Pine Island Glacier.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=196

To monitor and understand the Arctic atmosphere, there are number of key questions that need to be answered. In particular:

(1) How do clouds, aerosols and atmospheric chemistry interact to force the Pan-Arctic surface energy balances and albedo-temperature feedback?

(2) What is the relative role of tropospheric dynamics and stratospheric linkages in controlling the Arctic surface variability? 

(3) What portion of the recent changes in the Arctic weather and climate can be attributed to increases in anthropogenic sources?

(4) How does the Arctic atmosphere interact with the rest of the Arctic (marine, cryospheric and terrestrial) system?

(5) To answer these questions (and others), all of the available observational resources represented by surface and upper air network observations, intensive observatories, satellite observations, manned and unmanned airborne measurements, and focused field campaigns must be utilized. 

Specific tasks will be undertaken to:

* Coordinate the efforts at a number of atmospheric observatory sites that are year-round, intensive, permanent, and with sufficient infrastructure and personnel to operate sophisticated atmospheric instruments such as lidars and radars that can provide information for detailed process studies. 

* Integrate and where possible, co-locate sensors from distributed networks measuring parameters such as precipitation, atmospheric radiation, water vapour, aurora activity, ozone, chemistry/radio nuclides, fractional cloud cover, temperature, and winds. The intensive observatories will become super nodes in the network systems.

* Promote and enhance campaign activities that provide opportunities to make atmospheric measurements in logistically difficult locations, especially over the Arctic Ocean and surrounding Seas which are typically data sparse for surface-based atmospheric measurements. Examples of intensive programs include the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO  EoI 436), the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snow pack (OASIS-IPY, Activity 38), and the Arctic Summer Cloud-Ocean Study (ASCOS, EoI 212).

* Utilize and support innovative technologies, for instance unmanned aircraft such as the High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) UAV program, automated station technologies, and wind energy technologies (CAPWE, EoI 721). 

* Contribute observational products to modelling efforts such as POLARCAT (Activity 32).

* Contribute to defining the atmospheric component of larger, interdisciplinary Arctic observation coordination programs proposed for IPY such as Coordination of Observation and Monitoring of the Arctic for Assessment and Research (COMAAR  EoI 503). 

The primary intention of this proposal will be to develop a legacy of continuous measurements of the Arctic atmosphere that will be combined with additional measurements from episodic, focused, campaigns. The goal will be to have sufficient understanding to determine relative contributions of natural versus anthropogenic forces in shaping the nature of the Arctic atmosphere. This activity will additionally contribute to an evaluation of the resulting impacts on the larger Arctic physical and biological system, as well as assess the impacts of Arctic atmospheric issues on global climate/weather.

A particular emphasis will be to promote and integrate the activities of about five major, intensive, and permanent, observatories. This element will be responsive to a number of international assessments (e.g. IPCC, ACIA, AMAP) and research programs (WCRP, CliC, GEWEX and SEARCH) that have recommended that multi-disciplinary super-sites be developed to collect the information needed to determine the processes and drivers of environmental Arctic change across disciplines. 

An action item for this proposal will be to establish an active coordination committee that will develop plans to leverage individual efforts by information exchange, standardization of measurement practices, cooperative use of resources, and data exchanges. Scientific collaborations will be promoted between institutions, programs, and nations to produce a comprehensive understanding of the atmosphere in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The concept of CASES-99 was borne out of a scientific interest in
stable atmospheric conditions. The stable atmosphere, due to its
generally weak or intermittent turbulence (`bursting'), is the source
of a number of outstanding problems in atmospheric science,
agricultural meteorology, and signal propagation, amongothers. As
such, CASES-99 focussed it's Intense Observing Periods during the
clear sky, light near-surface wind, nocturnal boundary layer (NBL)
conditions, which are conducive to stable (Ri &gt; 0.25) and very stable
conditions (Ri &gt; 1.0). There are also significant components that will
study the transition periods (from daytime, unstable to nighttime,
stable conditions and vice-versa).

The experimental period was from October 1-31, 1999 near Leon, Kansas
(50 km) east of Wichita, Kansas with a 3 day intercomparison and
instrument testing period from September 27-30. This area was chosen
for CASES-99 due to its relative lack of obstacles, relatively flat
terrain (average slopes are 0.5 degrees), and reasonable access to
power and phone lines. A large number of instrumentswill be deployed
in a an area 4.8 x 3.2 km, to capture stable NBL heterogeneity, with
some outlying instrumentation. These instruments include a heavily
instrumented 60 m tower, numerous 10 m towers (many with flux
measurements), multiple radars, lidars, scintillometers, tethersondes,
rawinsondes and research aircraft. See the experimental design for
details.

CASES-99 was a very successful experiment and essentially all of our
scientific goals can be addressed with the data taken. The data is
stored for public use (no password protection) in the UCAR JOSS
CASES-99 Data Archive . The Archive contains quality-controlled data
complete with timestamps in UTC and descriptions of the data therein,
listed by data platform.

It consists of measuring, at pertinent scales in time and space, the evaporation flux in conjunction with the radiative, and meteorological and hydrological parameters which may be applied to calculate the evaporation flux. It is thus possible to test existing parameterizations of the evaporation flux as well as to develop new ones. Data from the Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment (HAPEX) consists of aircraft flights over Les Landes Forest and agricultural regions in Southwest France.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">AnSlope: Cross-Slope Exchanges at the Antarctic Slope Front</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">AnSlope seeks an answer to the question: What is the role of the Antarctic
Slope Front and continental slope morphology in the exchanges of mass, heat,
and freshwater between the shelf and oceanic regimes, in particular those
leading to outflows of dense water into intermediate and deep layers of the
adjacent deep basins and world ocean circulation?

The importance to the global ocean circulation and climate of cold water masses
originating in the Antarctic is now understood, but the processes by which
these water masses enter the deep ocean circulation are not. We have developed
a program called AnSlope to address this problem. Our primary goal is to
identify the principal physical processes that govern the transfer of
shelf-modified dense water into intermediate and deep layers of the adjacent
deep ocean. At the same time, we seek to understand the compensatory poleward
flow of waters from the oceanic regime. We identify the upper continental slope
as the critical gateway for the exchange of shelf and deep ocean waters. Here
the topography, velocity and density fields associated with the nearly
ubiquitous Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) must strongly influence the advective
and turbulent transfer of water properties between the shelf and oceanic
regimes.

AnSlope has four specific objectives: [A] Determine the ASF mean structure and
the principal scales of variability (spatial from ~1 km to ~100 km, and
temporal from tidal to seasonal), and estimate the role of the Front on
cross-slope exchanges and mixing of adjacent water masses; [B] Determine the
influence of slope topography (canyons, proximity to a continental boundary,
isobath divergence/convergence) on frontal location and outflow of dense Shelf
Water; [C] Establish the role of frontal instabilities, benthic boundary layer
transports, tides and other oscillatory processes on cross-slope advection and
fluxes; and [D] Assess the effect of diapycnal mixing (shear-driven and
double-diffusive), lateral mixing identified through intrusions, and
nonlinearities in the equation of state (thermobaricity and cabbeling) on the
rate of descent and fate of outflowing, near-freezing Shelf Water.

AnSlope addresses these objectives with an integrated observational and
modeling program structured as follows. A collaborative core program begins in
2002, containing the components considered central to meeting AnSlope
objectives, primarily through acquisition of a set of measurements focused over
the outer continental shelf and upper slope of the northwestern Ross Sea. This
will allow us to assess the regional AABW production rate, and to identify the
cross-front exchange processes that must be taken into account when assessing
provision of dense water to the deep basins elsewhere around Antarctica. The
core elements are: moorings; CTD/LADCP and CTD-based microstructure; tracers;
and basic tidal modeling. "Enhancement" proposals, to be submitted separately,
request support for the modeling studies that are necessary to fully exploit
the measurements and develop the techniques for parameterizing cross-front
exchanges in regional and global models. Three cruises are proposed, beginning
in Austral summer 2003, over a period of 12 to 14 months. Moorings would be in
place throughout this period. The Italian CLIMA program in the Ross Sea
provides a valuable international enhancement for the AnSlope observational
component. The German BRIOS-2 coupled ice-ocean GCM program is complementary to
the US process-oriented modeling studies, and provides a test-bed for
AnSlope-generated parameterizations of cross-front exchange.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Public Interest Group (GIP) Mercator Ocean was founded in April 2002 with a
brief from its six member organisations (CNES, Ifremer, IRD, Meteo-France,
CNRS, SHOM) to set up an operational system for describing the state of the
ocean, an integral part of our environment, at any given time and at any place
on our blue planet.  Input for the Mercator system comes from ocean
observations measured by satellites or in situ observations through
measurements taken at sea. These measurements are "ingested" (assimilated) by
the analysis and forecasting model. The assimilation of observation data in a
model is used to describe and forecast the state of the ocean for up to 14 days
ahead of time.

The project mission was thus defined in 1995 to meet a threefold objective:
* Develop an operational oceanography system
* Enable the development of applications by distributing its products
* Contribute to success of the international Godae experiment along
with the Jason (altimetry observation) and Coriolis (in situ
observations) programs. Together with the Jason (satellite observations)
program and Coriolis (in situ observations), Mercator (modelisation and
assimilation) is the french contribution to Godae (Global Ocean Data
Assimilation Experiment), first international experiment of operational
oceanography.

The intensive phase of Godae is taking place between 2003 and 2005 with the
rise of several centers around the world able to supply real-time global ocean
nowcasting and forecasting data. Mercator must be one of them.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">DISCOVERY 2010 will investigate and describe the response of an ocean ecosystem to climate variability, climate change and commercial exploitation. The programme builds on past studies by BAS on the detailed nature of the South Georgia marine ecosystem and its links with the large-scale physical and biological behaviour of the Southern Ocean. The aim is to identify, quantify and model key interactions and processes on scales that range from microscopic life forms to higher predators (penguins, albatrosses, seals and whales), and from the local to the circumpolar. Main objectives are to: Assess the links between the status of local marine food webs and variability and change in the Southern Ocean; and Develop a linked set of ecosystem models applying relevant marine physics and biology over scales from the local to that of the entire Southern Ocean.

DISCOVERY 2010 will undertake an integrated programme of shipboard and land-based field studies of the marine food web, combined with modelling. We will pay particular attention to critical phases in the life cycles of key species, and to examining interactive effects in food webs. Interacting biological and physical processes will be modelled across a range of spatial scales to significantly improve our representation of the ocean ecosystem, upon which sustainable management and the prediction of future climate change can be based. DISCOVERY 2010 will link to BIOFLAME, ACES, and COMPLEXITY, two international programmes, and to a collaborative programme with the University of East Anglia on the role of the Southern Ocean in the global carbon cycle. 

Component Projects of Discover 2010 are: DISCOVERY-OEM: Ocean Ecosystems and Management; DISCOVERY-FOOD-WEBS: Scotia Sea FOOD-WEBS; DISCOVERY-FLEXICON: FLEXIbility and CONstraints in life histories; DISCOVERY-CEMI: Circumpolar Ecosystems; Modelling and Integration

The products include sea-surface temperature and wind, air temperature, atmospheric water vapor, cloud water, and rain rate. A key element of DISCOVER is the merging of multiple sensors from multiple platforms into geophysical data sets consistent in both space and time.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

The Marine EcoSystems Analysis (MESA) Puget Sound Project has
undertaken intensive studies of Puget Sound, with particular
emphasis on such highly industrialized areas as Elliott and
Commencement Boys and Sinclair Inlet. These studies have
involved chemical, biological and oceanographic investigations
aimed at determining the concentrations, fates and effects of
toxic chemicals in the Puget Sound ecosystem. An integral part
of these studies has been toxicity tests with field-collected
sediments. The present study was initiated to extend sediment
toxicity testing to two previously untested industrialized Puget
Sound embayments: Bellingham Bay and Everett Harbor. Relatively
high concentrations of toxic chemicals had been reported from
these two areas (Malins et al., 1982).  The contaminant mixtures
discovered there differed somewhat from those observed in other
parts of Puget Sound. This study was initiated to determine if
sediments from these two areas were toxic or not. Toxicity
testing was also conducted south of Bellingham Bay at Samish
Bay, chosen as a reference area.  A total of 22 stations were
chosen for study: 10 in the Everett Harbor area, 10 in
Bellingham Bay, and 2 in Samish Bay. Composite sediment grab
samples were collected from each station and tested for acute
lethal, sublethal, partial life-cycle, cell reproduction and
genotoxic effects. These effects were examined utilizing
sensitive test methods applied elsewhere in Puget Sound (Chapman
et al., 1982a; in press a, b). An additional station south of
Everett Harbor was tested (with negative results) for acute
lethal and sublethal effects.  On the basis of acute lethal,
sublethal, partial life-cycle, cell reproduction and genotoxic
effects testing, Everett Harbor, Bellingham and Samish Bays were
less toxic than contaminated areas such as the Duwamish Waterway
(Elliott Bay) and the Commencement Bay Waterways. Everett Harbor
sediments were more toxic overall than those from Bellingham
Bay. Samish Bay sediments only showed toxicity in cell
reproduction and genotoxic tests, suggesting very different
sediment chemistry in this area.  Partial life-cycle bioassays
with oyster larvae (Crassostrea gigas) were conducted by
exposing fertilized eggs to settled sediment slurries for 48 h
then determining the number of live larvae and any
abnormalities. A total of 19 stations demonstrated significant
abnormalities or mortalities; the two reference stations showed
no significant effects.  Acute lethal bioassays were conducted
with the sensitive amphipod Rhepoxynius abronius. Two stations
(one each in Bellingham Bay and Everett-Harbor) demonstrated
significant acute lethal effects; the two reference stations
showed no significant effects.  Sublethal effects measurements
were conducted with the oligochaete Monopylephorus cuticulatus
by exposing the worms to sediment elutriates and measuring
respiration rates. Seven stations demonstrated significant
respiration rate differences compared to controls; the two
reference stations showed no significant effects.  Cell
reproduction studies were conducted by exposing rainbow trout
gonad (RTG-2) and bluegill fry (BF-2) cells to sediment extracts
during logarithmic growth. Eight stations (including one
reference station) significantly reduced cell growth in RTG-2
cells, and three stations (including both reference stations)
significantly reduced cell growth in BF-2 cells.  Genotoxic
tests for chromosomal damage were conducted by exposing RTG-2
cells to sediment extracts and determining mitotic (anaphase
aberration) effects.  Sediment extracts from eight stations
(including one reference station) caused significant chromosomal
damage.  Physical and chemical data for tested samples (particle
size, total volatile solids, digestible organic carbon, and
extractable organic matter) were within the ranges observed for
other areas of Puget Sound with the following exceptions. A high
clay content was noted in Bellingham Bay sediments and a high
percentage of total volatile solids was noted in inner Everett
Harbor sediments.

INTRODUCTION:

One of the intents of the MESA Puget Sound Project is to develop
an understanding of the effects of environmental contaminants upon
Puget Sound biota. High environmental levels of particular
chemicals have been detected in sediments from industrialized
embayments of Puget Sound, and a variety of in situ biological
effects (e.g. tissue abnormalities in fish and shellfish, changes in
biological community structure) occur in areas associated with high
levels of various contaminants (Malins et al., 1980, 1982; Dexter et
al., 1981; Long, 1982). Direct evidence of toxicity from Puget Sound
sediments has recently been provided for three of these industrialized
embayments: Elliott Bay, Commencement Bay and Sinclair Inlet
(Chapman et al., 1982a, in press a, b).
Contaminant mixtures found in sediments from Bellingham Bay and
Everett Harbor were known to differ from those of the previously
tested areas. However, the relative toxicity of sediments in these
two areas was unknown. Recent indirect evidence of the potential
for biological effects among biota captured in the two areas
has been collected.
Field studies have recently recorded fin rot and lesions in bottom
fish in Bellingham Bay and Everett Harbor (Campana, 1983;
Gronlund et al., 1983). The intent of the present study was to
determine whether marine sediments from these embayments also
exhibited toxic biological effects in direct exposure tests.
Accordingly, composited sediment grab samples were obtained from a
total of 22 stations (including a non-industrialized reference area,
Samish Bay). These samples were tested for possible biological
effects using a range of species and test methodologies. Sediment
collected from a station in Possession Sound, south of Everett
Harbor, was also tested on an opportunistic basis. The results were
used to determine the relative toxicity of Everett Harbor and
Bellingham Bay samples compared to those from other tested areas
of Puget Sound.

model was ... developed jointly by the Max-Planck Institute fuer 
Meteorologie (Hamburg), the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences Deacon 
Laboratory (IOSDL) and the Department of Environment Hydraulics 
Research Station. The model was primarily run in hindcast mode so as 
to generate wave fields from the surface wind and pressure fields of 
past storm events. By selecting a representative sample of the worst 
storms over a number of years, the wave data generated by the model 
can be used to provide an estimate of the distribution of extreme 
waves over the same period. For this purpose a special data set of 
surface winds and pressure fields - the NORSWAM Input Data Set - was 
compiled by IOSDL and the UK Meteorological Office.

The overall aim of the investigations is to improve the description and understanding of the Late Quaternary environmental changes at high latitudes and their impact on the earliest human occupation in northern Russia.

In contrast to Svalbard, Scandinavia and much of Northern Europe, where the youngest ice sheets erased most of the pre-existing records from earlier periods of the Quaternary, northern Russia contain much more complete geological and archaeological archives that are essential for deciphering the history of the entire Barents-Kara sea region and the early human adaptation to a cold climate.  We plan to carry out field expeditions in the European part of Russia as well as in West Siberia. The planned research activities will be a contribution to the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007 - 2008.  A main IPY activity will be to core lakes in the Polar Urals, which according to our hypothesis may contain uninterrupted records of the climate evolution that dates back to at least 60,000 years ago.

The project forms part of the programme APEX (Arctic Palaeoclimate and its Extremes) that has been selected as a lead coordinating programme for palaeoclimate research within the IPYcluster.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=405

Meltdown 3D: Global Warning is a new, multiple media, informal science education project in support of the Education and Outreach mission of the International Polar Year. Driven by a giant screen (IMAX-format) 3D and 2D film and enriched by outreach, Meltdown will advance public understanding of polar science and the importance of the Poles to the global climate system; inspire greater confidence in the results of scientific study; and advance an appreciation for science, not as something separate and remote, but as vital and relevant to everyday life. 

The film itself is wholly unconventional: a fast-moving, always surprising cinematic experience that weaves back and forth between live-action sequences shot in Earth's most extreme environments the Poles and stunning 3D animation depicting future conditions of our planet as modeled by the world's leading climatologists. It's a scientifically credible disaster film, designed to show the public exactly where our planet may be headed in larger-than-life pictures, and in ways words alone can't describe. 

Meltdown 3D will feature scientists at work in the field and will explore issues relating to polar melting, sea level rise, disruption of the thermohaline cycle, and coral bleaching, among others. The impact of the film will be enriched by extensive paper and web-based educational materials and activities, and further enhanced by a professional development programs for teachers, museum educators, and after-school program leaders. 

Meltdown 3D is currently in development, and is targeted to release in the final quarter of 2008 or the final quarter of 2009, coinciding with the second half of IPY (pending funding).

The basic methodology used to retrieve geophysical parameters
from the TOVS observations involves use of an interactive
forecast-retrieval-analysis scheme in which the first guess
information for the retrievals (surface pressure, temperature
profile, and moisture profile) comes from a 6 hour forecast
generated by a general circulation model. This information,
together with the observed radiances, is used to generate
retrievals for the 6 hour period centered on the forecast
time. An analysis is then performed using these retrievals and
all available in situ data for that time period. This is then
used as input to the forecast model and the cycle is repeated
for the next 6 hour period.

CAMEX-4 is focused on the study of tropical cyclone (hurricane)
development, tracking, intensification, and landfalling impacts using
NASA-funded aircraft and surface remote sensing instrumentation. The
primary aircraft used during CAMEX-4 are the NASA DC-8 and ER-2
research airborne platforms. These instrumented aircraft will fly
over, through, and around selected hurricanes as they approachlandfall
in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and along the east coast of the
United States. The NASA aircraft will investigate upper altitude
regions of the hurricane not normally sampled. Where possible,
measurements will be compared and validated with coincident
observations from the QuikSCAT, Terra, and Tropical Rainfall Measuring
Mission satellites. This study will yield high spatial and temporal
information of hurricane structure, dynamics, and motion. These data,
when analyzed within the context of more traditional aircraft,
satellite, and ground-based radar observations,should provide
additional insight to hurricane modelers and forecasters who
continually strive to improve hurricane predictions.More accurate
hurricane predictions at landfall will result in decreasing the size
of necessary coastal evacuations and increasing the warning time for
those areas.

While remote sensing of the hurricane environment is the primary
objective of CAMEX-4, there will also be separate flights to study
thunderstorm structure, precipitation systems, and atmospheric water
vapor profiles. This portion of CAMEX-4 is known as KAMP, Keys Area
Microphysics Project. The objective of the KAMPflights is to improve
quantitative precipitation estimates from passive and active microwave
instruments.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">From tentative first steps in the late 1970s, Australian research in Antarctic marine biology is now participating in international programs aimed at ensuring that harvesting of Southern Ocean living species can be sustained without harming this vital resource. The task is as herculean as it is important.

Australian research into Antarctic marine biology began in the late 1970s, spurred on by the establishment of the international BIOMASS (Biological Investigations into Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks) Program. Driven by the development of a fishery for krill, BIOMASS looked at the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill, seeking information on the interrelationships between krill and the other elements of the marine ecosystem.

Australian Antarctic marine research was made feasible by the conversion of the supply ship Nella Dan into a functional research vessel, in which the Australian Antarctic Division made its first concerted forays into open ocean research. Australia was a participant in the highly successful 1981 First International BIOMASS experiment (FIBEX) – the first attempt to survey the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill using acoustic techniques. The results from this huge effort, using 13 ships from 11 nations, were translated 10 years later into catch limits for the krill fishery in the Atlantic and South West Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean. The Second International BIOMASS Experiment (SIBEX) was fraught with logistic difficulties.

The Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB) Pilot Project encompasses
interactive modeling and observational studies of the coupled
atmosphere-surface-subsurface hydrology of the Black Hills area
of South Dakota and Wyoming. This NASA sponsored project
emphasizes coupled hydrologic modeling of Intermediate Scale
Areas (ISA) in orographic terrain, the use of observations of
differing temporal and spatial resolutions to assess ambient
variability as well as model and budget uncertainties and
sensitivities, intercomparison of sensors, and the
transferability of models from the Black Hills ISA to other
ISAs. Execution of this project is being coordinated with GEWEX
Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP) activities such
as the GCIP Large Scale-Northwest (LSA-NW) study.

The objectives of this project are to:

1. Assess the importance of "deep" groundwater in subsurface
aquifers to water budgets and water resources in the LSA-NW.

2. Determine the resolution required in atmospheric and coupled
models to represent adequately precipitation and other
components of the water budget in orographic terrain. Examine
sensitivities and important spatial scales for impacts due to
variations in evapotranspiration and moisture advection.

3. Determine the uncertainties in atmospheric components of the
water budgets on ISA and larger scales in orographic terrain.

The GLobal Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAP) is a cooperative
effort among 13 principal investigators, funded for several synthesis
and modeling projects through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National

ocean data synthesis projects.  There are currently four projects
involved in GLODAP. Cruises conducted as part of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE), Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS)
and NOAA Ocean-Atmosphere Exchange Study (OACES) over the decade of
the 90's have created an oceanographic database of unparalleled
quality and quantity. These data provide an important asset to the
scientific community investigating carbon cycling in the oceans. The
central objective of this project is to generate that unified data set
and to determine the global distribution and inventories of inorganic
nutrients, both natural and anthropogenic carbon species and natural
and bomb-produced radiocarbon.  These estimates will be used to infer
stochiometric remineralization ratios (Redfield ratios) and the rate
of anthropogenic CO2 and bomb 14C uptake in the oceans. These
estimates provide an important benchmark against which future
observational studies will be compared. They also provide tools for
the direct evaluation of numerical ocean carbon models.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Esecutive Summary of Project:


 Over its ten-year lifetime, the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere
 (TOGA) program (1985-1995) made major strides toward
 understanding the El Ni?o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
 phenomenon, which impacts surface air temperature and rainfall
 over many regions of the globe. In particular, TOGA
 demonstrated the feasibility of operational
 seasonal-to-interannual climate prediction of equatorial
 Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies based on numerical
 models that simulate, in a rudimentary manner, the physics of
 the coupled tropical ocean-atmosphere system, and it clarified
 the nature of the remote, planetary-scale atmospheric response
 to these anomalies. The U.S. Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land
 System (GOALS) program is predicated on the belief that the
 skill of operational climate prediction can be further
 increased by continued research on ENSO and by efforts to
 understand other elements of the climate system that contribute
 to the observed seasonal-to-interannual variability. The !  Pan
 American Climate Studies (PACS) program is a component of the
 U.S. GOALS program in the 1995-2005 time frame, and PACS
 provides a phenomenological context for some of the GOALS
 research.


 The overall goal of PACS is to extend the scope and improve the
 skill of operational seasonal-to-interannual climate prediction
 over the Americas. Particular emphasis is placed on warm season
 rainfall, which is not yet predictable. In the context of PACS,
 climate prediction is concerned not only with seasonal mean
 rainfall and temperature, but also with the frequency of
 occurrence of significant weather events such as hurricanes or
 floods over the course of a season or seasons.

 The scientific objectives of PACS are to promote a better
 understanding and more realistic simulation of (1) the boundary
 forcing of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations over the
 Americas, (2) the evolution of tropical sea surface temperature
 anomalies, (3) the seasonally varying mean climate over the
 Americas and adjacent ocean regions, (4) the time-dependent
 structure of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)/cold
 tongue complex, and (5) the relevant land surface processes.

 To state these objectives more explicitly:

 Boundary forcing: The atmospheric circulation, in isolation, is
 not predictable beyond a week or two. Hence, prospects for
 improved climate prediction on the seasonal-to-interannual time
 scale hinge on the ability to exploit the relationships between
 the planetary-scale atmospheric circulation and the slowly
 evolving and potentially predictable boundary forcing; i.e.,
 the fields of sea surface temperature, vegetation, and soil
 moisture, in which the season-to-season "memory" of the coupled
 ocean-atmosphere-land system resides. Improved understanding of
 boundary-forced atmospheric anomalies is of central importance,
 not only to PACS, but to the entire GOALS program.

 Evolution of tropical sea surface temperature anomalies: For
 climate prediction of a season or more in advance, it is
 necessary to take into account the evolution of the boundary
 forcing of the atmosphere. In keeping with the general strategy
 of GOALS, PACS will seek to advance the state-of-the-art of the
 prediction of sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical
 Atlantic and Pacific, both of which are known to influence
 climate variability over parts of the Americas.

 Seasonally varying mean climate: Regional rainfall anomalies
 over the Americas are largely a reflection of the
 intensification or weakening, or subtle displacements in
 positions of the climatological-mean features that organize the
 rainfall, i.e., the monsoons, the oceanic ITCZs, and the
 tropical and extratropical cyclone tracks. An understanding of
 these robust climatological-mean features and their seasonal
 evolution is a prerequisite for the interpretation and
 prediction of the anomalies.

 Structure of the ITCZ/cold tongue complex: A major stumbling
 block in the validation of the models used to simulate tropical
 atmosphere-ocean interaction in ENSO is the lack of
 observational data for defining the structure of the ocean
 mixed layer and the overlying atmosphere in the ITCZ/cold
 tongue complex. PACS will address this deficiency through its
 field projects and the related modeling studies that will make
 use of these data.

 Land surface processes: The distribution of rainfall over the
 Americas is shaped, not only by sea surface temperature patterns
 but also by land surface processes, particularly during the warm
 season, when vegetation and soil moisture are highly
 influential. Orography and coastal geometry mediate these
 effects and leave a distinctive mesoscale imprint upon the
 rainfall patterns. These issues will be addressed in
 collaboration with the Global Energy and Water Experiment
 (GEWEX) and its regional programs, with PACS supplying the
 atmospheric modeling expertise and GEWEX the hydrological
 expertise. Much of this research will require the use of
 mesoscale models, applied in a climatological setting.

 PACS scientific objectives (1) and (2) directly address the
 scientific objectives of the GOALS program: (1) relates to
 atmospheric prediction and (2) to prediction of tropical sea
 surface temperature; in this sense they may be viewed as
 primary. Objectives (3)-(5) play a supportive role by advancing
 understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to and limit the
 predictability of the coupled global ocean-atmosphere-land
 system: (3) and (4) relate to the prediction of ENSO and other
 phenomena that give rise to tropical sea surface temperature
 anomalies, and (5) relates to the prediction of continental
 rainfall.

 PACS encompasses a broad range of activities, including
 empirical studies, data set development, modeling, climate
 monitoring, and more intensive, limited-term field
 experiments. In order to avoid being spread too thin, the field
 studies will focus on different regions of the Pan-American
 climate system in sequence. During the first five years they
 will focus on atmosphere-ocean interaction in the tropical
 eastern Pacific, in association with the ENSO cycle and the
 climatological-mean annual march. During the second half of
 PACS the emphasis will shift to the tropical Atlantic Ocean
 where the sea surface temperature anomalies are more subtle and
 more diverse in terms of horizontal structure than in the
 Pacific, but no less important in terms of their influence upon
 precipitation in the adjacent continental regions.

 This scientific prospectus/implementation plan provides the
 motivation and scientific basis for PACS and describes the
 research that will be carried out in pursuit of PACS scientific
 objectives. Section 1 gives a scientific description of
 phenomena in the ocean-atmosphere system that are likely to be
 of importance for understanding and predicting
 seasonal-to-interannual climate variations over the
 Americas. The climate and weather variations over the Americas
 that provide the practical and scientific motivation for PACS
 are discussed in Section 2, while Sections 3-5 describe the
 empirical studies, data set development, and modeling that will
 be conducted under its auspices. Section 6 describes field
 studies envisioned for PACS, starting with projects already
 funded and going on to describe activities likely to be
 proposed for the 1997-2000 time frame. Section 7 discusses
 linkages with GEWEX and its regional programs and NASA's
 Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). Se!  ction 7 also
 describes the anticipated linkages with emerging national and
 international programs, including the Scripps-Lamont Consortium
 for the Ocean's Role in Climate (CORC), the Pilot Research
 Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA), the anticipated
 World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and
 Predictability (CLIVAR) international programs on the
 Variability of the American Monsoon Systems (VAMOS), and
 Pacific and Atlantic basinwide extended climate studies
 (BECS). Program management is discussed in Section 8. Within
 the U.S., interagency support is being sought for PACS, with
 coordination by the GOALS Project Office. The Inter-American
 Institute for Global Change Research serves as a vehicle for
 coordinating international cooperation.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST, http://www.postcoml.org/) project aims
to build an acoustic tracking array along the west coast of North America. The
early applications focused on tracking the migration, life span, movement and
behaviour of Pacific salmon. The project is expanding to encompass other
species such as rockfish, sturgeon and small pelagics.

The test array in the Salish Sea region, deployed in 2004-2005, demonstrates
that a large-scale monitoring system could be established to answer long-asked
questions about the lives of marine species.

The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking Project plans to complete the permanent
full-scale marine telemetry array along the North American Pacific coast, from
Baja to the Bering Sea, by 2010. The array will have 2000 receivers and 30
listening lines, each up to 50 km long. Capable of listening to over 250,000
animals at once, it will permit a near-complete census of the movements and
marine survival of animals ranging from small salmon smolts to large marine
mammals.

Funding was made possible by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Census of
Marine Life (click here for funding proposal), as well as the Gordon and Betty
Moore Foundation.

Project URL: http://nsidc.org/data/docs/arcss/arcss122/index.html
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=410
Inuit Voices is an exhibit to be designed collaboratively by the University of Colorado's Museum of Natural History (CU Museum) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), with advisors from the Iqaluit Museum in Nunavut, Canada, Inuit elders, and the US. We propose to prepare an exhibit that displays Inuit observations of environmental change in the Arctic. This exhibit will be based on research by Dr. Shari Gearheard and illustrated by objects from the CU Museum collection of Inuit artefacts. It is scheduled to open in April 2008 at the CU Museum.

As one component of her research in Nunavut, Dr. Gearheard produced a highly popular interactive, multimedia CD-ROM on Inuit observations of environmental change, entitled When the Weather is Uggianaqtuq (or
unpredictable), distributed by NSIDC. This product has appealed to a variety of audiences: social scientists, climate change researchers, indigenous communities, cryospheric scientists, K-12 educators, and the general public. The popularity of this product and Dr. Gearheard's extensive research inspired the collaboration between the CU Museum and NSIDC.

We plan to create a temporary 'Inuit Voices' exhibit to be displayed at the CU Museum, and also two sets of travelling exhibits, one in English for the US and one translated into Inuktitut for Nunavut, Canada. Traveling museum exhibits are an effective and creative way to expose a wide range of audiences to information and perspectives from various world cultures. The exhibit size will be suitable for display in small museums, tribal colleges and libraries with limited space and budgets. 

The exhibit will display the Uggianaqtuq CD-ROM and allow visitors to interact with the data and information it contains. Inuit artefacts and objects will be displayed as well, so that history and present technologies are joined in one exhibit.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">REPRESENTATIONS OF SAMI IN THE</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Representations of Sami in Nineteenth Century Polar Literature: The Arctic 'Other'</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Sami in travel writings form an image of a history being told about them. Being represented meant for the Sami that their lives and culture appeared stereotyped, because they inhabited areas that had been labelled as void from a scientific point of view ever since the time of Carl von Linné. The north was a place devoid of substance, which could therefore be filled with the explorers’ and researchers’ opinions and fantasies. During the nineteenth century, an interest in the exotic within the borders of the home nation was aroused, and in the process the Sami became objectified in travel writing. Polar travel writing formed part of the colonial project to conquer the northern parts of the Nordic countries, including Arctic areas. With reference to the Sami, this process provides us with simplified images. The representations of the Sami appear within a colonial discourse, in the form of depictions and explanations concerning the Arctic and the Sub-Arctic, and the people who inhabited these areas. It was common practice during the nineteenth century to discover “new” people and “new” cultures, and describe them, as a process of collecting information about them, and this was part of the colonial process as it was defined at that time. The depictions of the Sami in Sven Lovén’s travel journals from 1836-37, for instance, were mythical and ethnographical; they were also interwoven with perspectives on nature and the experience of being in an Arctic landscape that could be related to the Arctic sublime. There were also descriptions about the nature of the Sami, which could be connected to a three-dimensional layer of ethnocentrism, racism and exoticism. References to scientific works and literature also occurred in the text, but to a lesser extent. In other words, the several representations that existed at one and the same time may be divided into three themes that run parallel to one another in the travel writings of Lovén. References to scientific work were not so common in Lovén’s journals, and when they occurred they were usually dictionary references. Literature such as the epos Kalevala used, as references may be perceived as being of a mythical character. Other representations of a mythical character that related to the Sami were created in the context of socio-cultural descriptions, and may thus be perceived as ethnographic. The mythical and ethnographical representations were both embedded in romanticisation. Ethnographically coloured representations were common, for example, in art during the nineteenth century. These descriptions were close to the romantic view of the Sami. There were also descriptions of real dramas in the course voyages, and these may be detected as part of the Arctic sublime. In these descriptions, the Sami became a part of the Arctic sublime, since the Sami were perceived as able to interpret the behaviour of animals, which were part of the sublime. Depictions of the nature of the Sami formed another set of representations. The nature of the Sami is also connected to Sami society, described as being in opposition to Swedish/Western society, according to a racist perception of the Sami as being of a different race and nationality. Knowledge about the Sami decreased at the end of the nineteenth century, and this changed the image of the Sami to a more romantic perception, rather than a racist one. This romantic view was not part of the canon at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but it was nevertheless possible for this opinion to flourish. In travel writings from the nineteenth century it is clear that the travel writing contained personal opinions, which contaminated the text. People and cultures were designated as ‘the Other’ to define for the travellers what the former were not, i.e. Europeans. The stereotypical representations of the Sami may have been used to define what the explorers were not, in order not to risk becoming ‘the Other’ in the new and unknown environment that was the Arctic. Explorers were able to shift between representing Culture and being part of Nature at the same time. They never risked being estranged from themselves, since the otherness between Culture and Nature was inhabited by ‘the Other’. The in-between space was a place for explorers to get to know the wild man inside themselves, but since this space was already inhabited by ‘the Other’ this exploration could not get out of hand and result in the explorer turning into an alien being, or monster.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      SCWA (Seminole County Watershed Atlas)is designed to provide
      citizens, scientists, and planners of the region with
      comprehensive and current water quality, hydrologic, and

      found it difficult to gather the information they need from the
      myriad of agencies that collect the related data. To solve this
      problem, we conceived of the Atlas as a "One Stop Information
      Shop" for concerned citizens and scientists alike. The Atlas
      functions as a warehouse for a variety of water resources
      information, including documents and educational links. We have
      also strived to make the Atlas a rich resource that educates
      citizens about the data presented and gives scientists easy
      access to the specialized information they need. We encourage
      you to use the Atlas as a tool to help in maintaining and

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=191


The aim of the activity is to open up the possibility for researchers from developing countries to research and development activities in the Antarctic, introducing a whole new group of people who have limited exposure to this field, to the culture of international scientific cooperation in Antarctica, and its relevance in the wider scheme of things.

The Antarctic Treaty claimed the continent for all humanity, and yet, 50 years after the IGY 1957, research on the 6th continent is still open to only a limited number of countries who are fortunate enough to have the resources and the infrastructure to support their research activities.

With the menace of climate change looming over the future of the planet, the importance of the contribution of research carried out in the Polar Regions in the understanding of climate mechanisms should be made apparent to the wider World. 

The project aims to create a network of interested parties consisting of research institutions, funding agencies, logistics providers, international organisations, and NGOs to support the development of competences in non-traditionally polar countries, and thus creating improved conditions for exploring regional interlinkages. 

SCAR scientific fellowships will be provided to facilitate the participation of graduate students/ researchers from developing countries in research activities of the participating institutes. 

Certain Antarctic bases will allow selected researchers to spend time on the Antarctic continent. Logistics will be provided to the participating scientists by national operators. Host universities/ institutes will provide training and facilities. The researchers daily needs will be funded by capacity building measures from participating international organisations.

The activity will benefit from education, communication and outreach support in order to communicate on the experiences, of the first groups of selected researchers, to a large international audience, so that there is maximum benefit gained from the activity in mobilising decision makers and potential young scientists. 

The scientific activities carried out during the International Polar Year will, through a knock on effect, lead to the opening up of new disciplines in developing country universities: glaciology, meteorology, climate modelling etc. which could then be integrated into the international network of scientific research activities, thereby reinforcing the regional development of observation and modelling activities, and completing it for areas where there is little actual data.

This movement outwards would also empower scientists from the developing World and give them the feeling of being a part of global concerns, of being actively engaged in improving the future for their compatriots as well as for the wider human community.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Like the July 2005 submission this is a living document which evolves as partnerships and resources are negotiated. Health related mega-projects in the Arctic have so far highlighted diseases and illnesses separating the aspirations and the accomplishments of Arctic peoples. This programme is framed by Arctic peoples’ resiliency, where partnerships are fostered which highlights the strength and aspiration of Arctic residents. Over the last few decades many Canadian Arctic peoples have negotiated land claims and set up governance and structures to protect and enhance their knowledge, languages. This will cover the first theme of the three proposed for this project; namely the Dynamics of Governance and Local Authority. This includes issues such as self-determination, governance, economic change and community dynamics.

Secondly, within this model specific health concerns will be addressed including diabetes, heart disease, HIV, cancer, mental health, injuries. In addition factors that contribute to health including genuine progress indicators, water, environmental health, ownership of health, addictions, lifestyle, technology impacts and cumulative effects will be explored. The second theme of this project, then covers Northern Health Indicators, which addresses issues such as unintentional/intentional injuries, mental health lifestyle (addictions), and genuine progress indicators.

This programme is also framed by having to understand the Arctic peoples’ health through diversity by brining in issues from the point of view gender, and youth. This will aid in animating the cultural and individual contributions. An overarching community driven, Arctic lead, health and wellness research network is proposed that facilitates and participates in health research activities during the IPY within a model in which the resiliency and diversity of Arctic peoples is highlighted to answer questions that will create healthy environments and improve the health of persons in the circumpolar Arctic

This Canadian led Network would link territories, countries, communities, researchers, research and data management and that would serve as an international Canadian led legacy for IPY. It will also ensure best practices for community based health and wellness research throughout the IPY. As well as create a legacy for health research in Circumpolar Health Research across the Circumpolar North.

The above will be done through the creation of a network which allows for communication and integration of knowledge from various sources including medical science, traditional knowledge, social sciences, environmental sciences, biological, sociological historical – to mention few. And these will allow the third theme Northern Populations in Transition to emerge where topics like environmental change, technology and traditional foods and medicines come to play a role in understanding Arctic health in broadest sense.

The primary goal of Lake-Induced Convection Experiment (LAKE-ICE) are
to determine the mechanisms which control the structure and evolution
of mesoscale convective circulations in boundary layers over Lake
Michigan and to determine interrelationships between these mesoscale
circulations, fluxes throughout the depth of the boundary layer, and
cloud and precipitation development. Additionally, Lake-ICE seeks to

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

Scientific Objectives:
 - To produce a global, reduced resolution, infrared and visible,
   calibrated and normalized radiance data set containing basic information
   on the radiative properties of the atmosphere from which cloud parameters
   can be derived.
 - To stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques for inferring
   the physical properties of clouds from the condensed radiance data set and
   to apply the resulting algorithms to derive and validate a global cloud
   climatology for improving the parameterization of clouds in climate
   models.
 - To promote research using ISCCP data and contributing to improved
   understanding of the Earth's radiation budget (top of the atmosphere and
   surface) and hydrological cycle.
Project Description:
   The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) was
   established as the first project of the World Climate Research Programme
   (WCP-2) to collect and analyze satellite radiance measurements to infer
   the global distribution of cloud radiative properties and their diurnal
   and seasonal variations.  The operational phase of ISCCP began in July
   1983 and is currently planned to continue through June 2000.
   Global coverage for ISCCP is provided by the five geostationary
   meteorological satellites (GOES-EAST, GOES-WEST, GMS, INSAT, and METEOSAT)
   and at least one polar orbiting NOAA satellite.  The primary data are from
   the two standard visible (0.6 micrometers) and infrared (11 micrometers)
   channels common to all of the satellites.  The polar orbiter provides
   coverage of the polar regions not viewed by the geostationary satellites
   and is used as a basis for normalization of the radiances observed by the
   different geostationary satellites.
   The strategy adopted for implementing ISCCP reflects the diverse
   nature of the spaceborne observing system and the large volume of
   imaging and other correlative data.  The primary data processing is
   done by eight institutions: a Satellite Processing Center (SPC) for
   each satellite (nominally at least one polar orbiter and five
   geostationary satellites), the Satellite Calibration Center (SCC),
   and the Global Processing Center (GPC).  The SPC's task is to
   collect raw satellite image data and reduce its volume.  The SCC
   routinely receives special high resolution-image data from each of
   the SPCs.  These data are used to normalize the calibration of each
   geostationary satellite to the polar orbiter.  The resulting
   normalization coefficients are sent to the GPC to be used in data
   production.  The SPC sends the reduced image data to the GPC for
   further processing of the ISCCP B3 and C1/C2 data.
   In addition to the primary data processing centers, there are three other
   centers:  the Correlative Data Center of which a main function is to
   coordinate the delivery of other satellite and conventional data
   (correlative data) to the GPC for use in the cloud analysis, the ISCCP
   Central Archive (ICA), which is responsible for the archival of all data
   produced by ISCCP, and the EOSDIS Langley DAAC, which archives and
   distributes ISCCP B3, C1 and C2 data.
   Representatives of the following ISCCP Data Management Centers: SPC, SCC,
   GPC, Correlative Data Center, and ICA form the ISCCP Working Group on Data
   Management (WGDM) for the Joint Scientific Committee (JSC).  Scientific
   guidance is provided to the project by the International Radiation
   Commission of IAMAP and by the JSC Working Group on Radiation Fluxes.
   ISCCP B3 data are the primary global radiance data product used in the
   cloud analysis.  The ISCCP cloud analysis has three fundamental parts:
   cloud detection, radiative transfer model analysis, and statistical
   analysis.  The first part determines whether a particular radiance
   measurement is associated with cloudy or clear conditions.  The second
   part compares the measured radiances, together with other correlative
   information about the atmosphere and surface, to a radiative model to
   retrieve several cloud (and surface) parameters.  The third part
   accumulates spatial distribution information about the radiances and
   retrieved parameters to summarize the analysis, every 3 hours in C1 data
   and once per month in C2 data.
   The ISCCP C1 and C2, along with the previously unavailable CX data
   products were made available in 1995.  These new products are
   called D1, D2 and DX.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">From October 1991 through March 1992, the NASA ER-2 and the DC-8 aircraft were flown out of Fairbanks, Alaska, and Bangor, Maine, to examine the evolution of the chemistry of the stratospheric polar vortex over the course of the winter. This was AASE II.       
      
AASE II began about two and a half years after the Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Experiment (AASE), which determined that the chlorine chemistry in the Northern Hemisphere polar winter stratosphere was indeed perturbed, similar to the situation in the Southern Hemisphere winter. This mission was designed to measure chemical and meteorological variables as the Northern polar vortex--the ring of winds which circles the pole in winter--evolved through the season.
      
The first deployment was out of Fairbanks, Alaska, in October 1991. The ER-2 flew north to the pole to survey the beginnings of the polar vortex. Subsequent deployments were staged from Bangor, Maine, for two-week periods spaced about two weeks apart from November 1991 through March 1992. Most flights were north towards the polar vortex, but a few went south towards the tropics to survey aerosols injected into the stratosphere by the eruption of the Pinatubo volcano in June 1991.
       
The ER-2 was joined by the NASA DC-8 beginning with the January deployment. The DC-8, which has a much longer range than the ER-2, flew circuits from NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, to Fairbanks, Alaska, to Stavanger, Norway, to Bangor, Maine, and then back to NASA Ames.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Sea level and tidal science in the polar oceans</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The measurement of sea level along polar coastlines presents great technical challenges for the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) of the WMO/IOC Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM). The need for measurements in these data sparse regions has been clearly made in the scientific literature. For example, in oceanography, Arctic sea level data presently available suggest a common-mode of variability which provides insights in the quasi-resonant dynamics of the Arctic Ocean. Arctic sea level data are of particular interest within water balance studies concerning the freshening of the Arctic Ocean and its relationship to the Arctic Oscillation. Antarctic sea level changes have also been found to demonstrate considerable coherence related to the Southern Annular Mode and transports in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The need for measurements for climate studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also been clearly made. Monitoring of levels in both high-latitude regions is necessary to understand more completely the spatial pattern of long term sea level change due to ocean warming and ice melt. Climate and sea level changes also affect the stability of ice shelves and fast ice and the glaciers behind them.This project will use existing and new Arctic sea level recorders (there are no sites currently operational in Greenland, for example) and will make enhancements to the existing network of gauges in Antarctica. Past and future tide gauge data sets will be used in combination with satellite altimeter and space gravity data where possible to understand further the regional ocean dynamics and climate change (EoI 580). Differences between Arctic and Antarctic in ocean dynamics and sea level response to climate change are particularly interesting. The new recorders will be high technology devices providing data at high frequency and real time, comprising the core of ongoing polar sea level monitoring networks. This will be an essential component of GLOSS and a major legacy of IPY (EoI 211).
Benefits from enhanced polar networks can be anticipated in many ways not yet clear. However, sea level data are indispensable in many countries for practical applications such as flood warning, navigation, civil engineering and environmental monitoring, in addition to their scientific applications. Consequently, Arctic communities can be expected to benefit from investment in this collaborative sea level research. For example, the GREENSEAL project (EoI 761) will focus on developing the GLOSS network in Greenland which will benefit Arctic ocean circulation and sea ice flow studies, as well as providing essential practical data sets to local communities. The LEVANS project (EoI 304) will enhance corresponding data sets and understanding in Nordic Seas, while the Russian Arctic networks project (EoI 732) will see similar benefits to Russian science and coastal communities.
The further understanding of ocean tides in polar regions is a particularly important component of sea level studies, being relevant to a range of geophysical (e.g. dissipation), physical oceanographic (mixing), glaciological (sea ice formation) and biological studies (EoI 590). High latitude bathymetry and sub-ice-shelf topography are needed in addition to tidal measurements from coastal and bottom tide gauges and (where possible) altimetry over ocean and ice-shelves.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">NS&amp;T</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">National Status and Trends Program</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The National Status and Trends (NS&amp;T) program monitors the spatial
distributions, temporal trends and biological effects of chemical pollutants
in estuarine and coastal marine areas of the  United States.  The program was
designed to help determine the present conditions of the Nation's coastal
marine environment, and establish whether these conditions are improving or
declining.  To accomplish this, the program annually measures the
concentrations of selected contaminants in marine biota and sediments,
collected from coastal areas around the country.  The relationship between
contaminant exposure and indicators of biological responses in marine
organisms is also examined.  Policy makers and resource managers may use NS&amp;T
data to help assess the effects of human activities on the coastal marine
environment and to indicate areas where pollution control measures are working
or might be needed.
The NS&amp;T program is administered by ORCA's Coastal Monitoring and Bioeffects
Division (CMBAD), in conjunction with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) and the Office of NOAA Corps Operations; ORCA is a major line office of
the National Ocean Service (NOS) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA).  Some components of the NS&amp;T program are conducted
through cooperative agreements with state and regional environmental monitoring
programs.
The primary emphasis of the NS&amp;T program is the determination of the status
and effects of toxic chemicals in coastal marine and estuarine areas.  Through
its Mussel Watch Project, the program monitors the levels of over 70
contaminants in sediments and the soft tissue of mussels and oysters.  The
program's Benthic Surveillance Project monitors the same suite of chemicals in
sediments and benthic (bottom-dwelling) fish, and additionally analyzes fish
for disease conditions and specific physiological responses that are
associated with contaminant exposure.  The chemicals selected by the NS&amp;T
program serve as indicators of human activity and, at certain levels, may be
acutely or chronically toxic to marine life.  Monitored contaminants include
24 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); 20 congeners of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs); 15 chlorinated pesticides, including Chlordane and DDT (and
breakdown elements of DDT); butyltins; four major elements; and 12 trace
elements.  Sediments also are analyzed for total organic carbon content (TOC),
and for spore concentrations of the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, which
is associated with sewage contamination.  The grain size distribution among
sediment particles also is recorded to account for differences among
contaminant levels, due to differing capacities for sediments to accumulate
contaminants.
The NS&amp;T program also conducts Bioeffects Surveys, and prepares Historical
Trends reports and Coastal Contamination Assessments in selected coastal
areas.  Bioeffects Surveys provide information on the magnitude and extent of
contaminant-associated effects by measuring such properties as external and
internal disease, reproductive impairment and genetic damage in fish and
bivalves, and sediment toxicity resulting from contaminants.  Historical
Trends reports identify patterns of contamination in selected coastal areas
over extended periods of time.  These studies compare new NS&amp;T data with
pertinent historical data, including chemical analyses of of sediment core
segments.  Coastal Contamination Assessments combine contaminant findings with
such estuarine-related information as hydrologic features, point source
characteristics, and projected population trends to provide comprehensive
environmental assessments of selected coastal areas.
The NS&amp;T program concentrates on estuaries, bays, and near-shore marine areas.
Through the program's Mussel Watch and Benthic Surveillance projects, samples
are collected at regular intervals from over 300 sites throughout the United
States, including Alaska and Hawaii.  Monitoring activities are designed to
describe national and regional distributions of contamination.  Sampling sites
generally are located between 10 and 100 kilometers apart.  Sites are selected
to represent contaminant levels in the surrounding area and to avoid
small-scale patches of contamination, or 'hot spots'.  Conversely, Bioeffects
Surveys are performed in areas where NS&amp;T monitoring projects indicate high
chemical pollutant levels.  These surveys are conducted primarily in urban
embayment areas, such as Boston Harbor, Tampa Bay, and the Southern California
Bight.  Coastal Contamination Assessments are directed toward estuaries and
embayments such as the Long Island Sound, and larger regions, such the Gulf of
Maine.  Sediment core samples for NS&amp;T's Historical Trends studies also are
collected from selected estuaries and embayments.
The NS&amp;T program was initiated in 1984.  A primary objective of the program is
to determine the current status and distribution through time of chemical
pollutants.  To accomplish this, samples are collected from most NS&amp;T
monitoring sites on an annual basis.  Presently, the NS&amp;T monitoring data base
contains data on contaminant concentrations in fish livers collected from 1984
to 1988, and in molluscan tissues collected from 1986 to 1990.  The data base
also contains data on contaminant concentrations in sediments from selected
sites collected from 1984 to the present.  Recent trends in contamination may
be inferred by comparing NS&amp;T data with relevant historical data, derived from
other sources.  Data from NS&amp;T core sample analyses will allow the
determination of contaminant trends since pre-industrial times.  Since 1986,
the NS&amp;T program has conducted biological effects surveys, ranging from two to
four years in duration.
Quality Assurance is a major component of the NS&amp;T program, as it is necessary
that the analytical data generated by participating laboratories be consistent
and of known quality.  Analytical procedures adhere to the standard procedures
of the NS&amp;T Quality Assurance (QA) Project, established for all laboratories
participating in the NS&amp;T program.  As part of the QA Project, laboratories
associated with the NS&amp;T program participate in yearly intercomparison
exercises administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), and the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada.  The NS&amp;T program
also administers a 'specimen bank' of samples for the purpose of retrospective
analyses.  Samples are  collected from selected NS&amp;T monitoring sites,
preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored  at -150 C at the NIST facility in
Gaithersburg, Maryland.
NS&amp;T data are available in a variety of reports and publications (over 400 to
date).  Raw data from the Benthic Surveillance Project (1984- 88) and Mussel
Watch Project (1986-90) are available upon request in microfiche format and on
3.5' PC and Macintosh computer diskettes.  In conjunction with ORCA's
Strategic Environmental Assessment Division (SEA), the NS&amp;T program is
developing a desk-top database information and display system that will allow
the portrayal of spatial distributions and temporal trends of contamination in
the coastal marine environment.  Software has been developed for examining,
displaying, and mapping environmental and natural resource information on
high-resolution base maps.  Using Macintosh-related software, NS&amp;T data will
be expressed in graph form and on high- resolution base maps.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Wake Island Passage Flux Experiment (WIFE) was carried out from 2003 to 2005 to clarify and accurately quantify the temporal means and variations of heat content and volume transport of abyssal water in the North Pacific. WIFE consisted of repeated shipboard hydrographic surveys and mooring array observations along a line across a deep passage just south of Wake Island Passage (Uchida et al. 2007b). This study was designed to obtain time series measurements of heat content by using moored conductivity– temperature–depth (CTD) recorders and of volume transport by geostrophic calculations based on density measurements from the moored CTDs referenced to velocity measurements by moored current meters also deployed during the WIFE. Since changes in temperature and salinity of the abyssal water are small, moored CTD data must be accurately calibrated to shipboard CTD data.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The project EUROCS aims to improve the treatment of cloud systems in global and regional climate models. In addition, benefits will be also gained for hydrology and severe weather issues. Clouds probably remain the largest source of uncertainty affecting evaluations of climate change in response to anthropogenic change. The recent interest to develop capability to predict regional changes of climate, stress also the importance to better represent clouds in models. EUROCS concentrates its efforts on 4 major and well identified deficiencies of climate models: 
I.           stratocumulus over ocean, 
II.          diurnal cycle of cumulus, 
III.         diurnal cycle of precipitating deep convection over continents, 
IV.        sensitivity of deep convection development on the moisture profile.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Ecosystem Studies of Subarctic and Arctic Regions</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Proposal URL: 
http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=155

ESSAR addresses how climate variability and change affects the marine
ecosystems of the polar (Subarctic and Arctic) seas and their
sustainability. To provide accurate projections on the impact of
climate warming on these ecosystems requires improved knowledge of its
components and their linkages. Because of the complexity of the
interactions, accurate predictions of what will happen to individual
species requires knowledge on key life-history traits and of what will
happen to the ecosystem as a whole, as species do not function
separately from their ecosystem. ESSAR, therefore, encompasses
retrospective and field studies on physics, plankton, benthos, fish
and shellfish, marine mammals, sea birds and humans. The field studies
will be carried out in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans during
2007-2008. The data gathered will be used, together with bio-physical
models, to make quantifiable predictions of the effects of both
climate variability and long-term climate change on arctic polar
marine ecosystems.

To understand the effects of climate variability and change on marine
ecosystems we first must document what changes have occurred in the
physical oceanography, as well as understand the driving forces behind
them. ESSAR will therefore assemble historical data on the physical
oceanography and collect new data to fill in critical gaps in our
knowledge, such as moored current measurements in the Davis
Strait-Hudson Strait-Labrador Shelf region and in the northern Barents
Sea between Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. With recent reductions in
sea ice and predictions of much greater reductions, ESSAR will address
the effects of changes in sea ice on various parts of the
ecosystem. Results from past and present studies will be assembled to
document distributional shifts of several marine species from plankton
to marine mammals and seabirds. Also, new field studies in the
Subarctic of both the Pacific and Atlantic, and in the Arctic, will
examine the relationship between thermal heating of the waters and
changes in ice coverage, including various feedback
mechanisms. Nutrient, chlorophyll, ice algae, chemical tracers,
phytoplankton and zooplankton measurements will determine the effect
of ice decline on biological processes. An important change following
the reduction in ice will be an increase in light levels. Detailed
studies of the role of light levels on primary and secondary
production along the latitudinal gradients from 45°N to near the pole
will determine how light levels and day duration modify ecosystem
function. The effects of water mass transformations on plankton
production will be compared and contrasted with the effects of sea ice
and light to determine their relative importance. Our understanding of
the sources and variability in zooplankton and their role in the food
chain varies regionally. Data are relatively scarce in the Labrador
Sea, therefore, under ESSAR, concentrated zooplankton studies,
especially on Calanus finmarchicus, will be carried out.  Field-based
studies will also focus on the effects of the physical variability on
the energy flow through Arctic and Subarctic marine food webs from
plankton through fish to marine mammals and seabirds, e.g. in the
Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, Lancaster Sound and Hudson Bay. From
the human perspective, certain marine species are more important than
others because of their commercial or subsistence values. The physical
environment also influences these species, but our understanding of
the mechanisms is limited. One of the most important commercial
species in the Northwest Atlantic is shrimp (Pandulus borealis). As
part of ESSAR, there will be studies of the role of physical
oceanography and biological production cycles in recruitment,
abundance and distribution of shrimp in Davis Strait, off West
Greenland, on the Labrador Shelf and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. At
the upper ends of the food web, marine mammals and seabirds will be
affected by changes in the lower ends. Studies will determine the role
of changes in sea ice and warming waters on marine mammal fitness,
including whales, walruses, seals and polar bears. Seabirds respond
relatively quickly to changes in their prey and often can be monitored
relatively easily compared to their prey in the marine
environment. ESSAR, through the Circumpolar Seabird Group (CBird) and
the members of Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF), will
monitor how changes in productivity of Arctic and Sub-Arctic seas
affect circumpolar seabird populations. Seabird diet studies also will
be carried out and compared to similar studies conducted in the 1970s
and 1980s as a means of detecting if and how the marine ecosystem has
changed. As well, detailed studies in the smaller region of Svalbard
will be carried out to investigate the changes in seabird community
structure as a function of temperature and zooplankton. The effects of
these changes to the bird community on the terrestrial ecosystem
through the guano deposited back on land will also be part of this
study. Finally, comparisons between the various geographic regions to
provide additional insights will be an important component of ESSAR.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
This project seeks to determine how trace gases are exchanged
between the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) and the upper
atmosphere where the ozone layer is located (the
stratosphere). This is critical to assessing the effects of
natural and human-induced surface emissions on the potential for
ozone depletion and global warming. To develop an understanding
of transport processes in the lower stratosphere and at its
lower boundary, specific scientific questions are addressed: (1)
how does air move upward into the stratosphere in the tropics?
(2) can these processes of upward movement explain the extreme
dryness of the stratosphere? (3) what is the nature and
importance of wave motions produced by rapidly rising air in the
tropics? and (4) how does air move between the tropics and
midlatitudes in the stratosphere?

The approach involves the analysis of ER-2 measurements from
data obtained from the Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange Project
(STEP), with additional aircraft data from the Airborne
Antarctic Ozone Experiment and the Airborne Arctic Stratosphere
Expedition. So far, the data from STEP have (1) provided
explanations for how tropical clouds move air from the
troposphere to the stratosphere; (2) shown that the tops of
these clouds are dry enough to account for low stratospheric
humidities; (3) measured wavelike structures produced above
tropical clouds; and (4) shown that other wavelike structures
can move stratospheric air from the tropics to the midlatitudes.

Logistic courses of Astrolabe, make it possible to reach zones very little studied and to document them in order to include/understand the processes which explain the variations space-time of pCO2 with average scale in the southern oceanic areas. Data collected during these programs will be used as a basis to make estimates of the interannual variability and average variation (tendency) of flow Net of CO2 to the interface ocean-atmosphere; an extention of this program was required (realization of some hydrographic stations average depths during one of rotations), which will make it possible to apprehend calculation by various methods of the CO2 signal anthropic which penetrates in the ocean in this southern sector. By identifying and quantifying CO2 sources and sinks, observations collected at the time of campaigns MINERVE are also used to other teams to force atmospheric models and to validate biogeochemical models based on models of oceanic circulation general which try to simulate the cycle of oceanic carbon in the medium and long term.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">BIANZOII will investigate biodiversity patterns of the Antarctic zoobenthos and their causal processes for three representative groups of different size categories: nematodes (meiobenthos), amphipods (macrobenthos) and echinoids (megabenthos). Trophodynamic aspects of these benthic groups and their ability to cope with temperature and temperature-related changes (food composition and availability, pH of the seawater...) will be studied mainly in an experimental approach. Information collected in previous studies and in the first two work packages will be used to initiate the development of a model about the possible changes in the benthic communities due to global environmental change.

Expected results and/or products are:
1. An improved knowledge of the composition and biogeography of the target groups in poorly known parts of the Southern Ocean, e.g. the deep-sea and a recently collapsed ice shelf east of the Antarctic Peninsula;

2. An improved knowledge of species diversity and distribution patterns and similarities with oceans worldwide;

3. A better understanding of the trophic position of the three benthic taxa;

4. An evaluation of the share of prokaryotes in benthic energy flows through amphipods;

5. An estimation of metabolic rates of scavenger amphipods based on respiration and excretion measurements;

6. Characterization of the trophic categories of Antarctic echinoids and feeding plasticity of selected taxa;

7. Measuring the effect of seawater acidification on the skeletogenesis of selected taxa.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Amphibian Specialist Group strives to conserve biological diversity by stimulating, developing, and executing practical programs to conserve amphibians and their habitats around the world. This will be achieved by supporting a global web of partners to develop funding, capacity and technology transfer to achieve shared, strategic amphibian conservation goals.
How the ASG was formed

In September 2005 in Washington, DC, a Summit was convened by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and Conservation International to bring together the world leaders in amphibian conservation. The purpose: to devise a global strategy of action to arrest amphibian declines and extinctions. The Summit produced a declaration (PDF) and a more comprehensive Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ACAP) will be published in early 2007. Because of the scale of response required to tackle the current amphibian crisis, the decision was made to merge the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force (DAPTF), the Global Amphibian Specialist Group (GASG) and the Global Amphibian Assessment into a unified body devoted to Global amphibian conservation: The IUCN/SSC Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG).

The ASG takes IUCN's Specialist Group model to the next level of effectiveness through the establishment of a Secretariat and that will serve as dynamic hub to coordinate Regional centers and a global web of stakeholders and to leverage the intellectual, institutional, and financial capacity towards shared, strategic amphibian conservation goals.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The IOCs International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) was established in 1961 to enhance marine research, exploitation and development by facilitating the exchange of oceanographic data and information between participating Member States and by meeting the needs of users for data and information products. 
Formally the IODE started out as a Working Group on Oceanographic Data Exchange which was created by the First IOC Assembly (19-27 October 1961) through Resolution I-9. The Working Group became a Working Committee in 1973 through Resolution VIII-31, adopted by the 8th Session of the IOC Assembly (5-17 November 1973). 

The IODE system forms a worldwide service oriented network consisting of DNAs (Designated National Agencies), NODCs (National Oceanographic Data Centres), RNODCs (Responsible National Oceanographic Data Centres) and WDCs (World Data Centres  Oceanography). During the past 40 years, IOC Member States have established over 60 oceanographic data centres in as many countries.
This network has been able to collect, control the quality of, and archive millions of ocean observations, and makes these available to Member States. 

With the advance of oceanography from a science dealing mostly with local processes to one that is also studying ocean basin and global processes, researchers depend critically on the availability of an international exchange system to provide data and information from all available sources. Additionally, scientists studying local processes benefit substantially from access to data collected by other Member States in their area of interest. The economic benefit of obtaining data by exchange as opposed to collecting it oneself is huge. 
The main objectives of the IODE Programme are : 

(i) to facilitate and promote the exchange of all marine data and information including metadata, products and information in real-time, near real time and delayed mode; 

(ii) to ensure the long term archival, management and services of all marine data and information; 

(iii) to promote the use of international standards, and develop or help in the development of standards and methods for the global exchange of marine data and information, using the most appropriate information management and information technology; 

(iv) to assist Member States to acquire the necessary capacity to manage marine data and information and become partners in the IODE network; and 

(v) to support international scientific and operational marine programmes of IOC and WMO and their sponsor organisations with advice and data management services.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: Indigenous Forum on Monitoring (IFM)
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=396

The Indigenous Peoples Forum on Environmental Monitoring in the Arctic (IFM) will bring Indigenous knowledge and perspectives out of the anecdotal background into the forefront of environmental monitoring work in the Arctic. It will be held early on (Fall 2007) in the IPY timeframe, and will therefore be able to serve as a guiding tool to subsequent IPY Arctic initiatives.

Indigenous observations are the most regular and ground-based insight on the current status of Arctic environment and wildlife. Accordingly, the IFM will highlight the capacity of Indigenous Peoples to make a crucial contribution to the design and management of Arctic environmental monitoring. It will also raise awareness of Indigenous environmental issues and concerns within the Arctic scientific community, and consequently support the active involvement of Indigenous Peoples in research that directly affects their communities and well-being. In that regards, the participation of Inuit elders in the recent United Nations climate change conference (CoP11) in Montreal highlights the unique and invaluable contribution that Indigenous Peoples observations, knowledge and experiences can bring to debates on the Arctic environment.

This Indigenous-led project will actively engage members of Northern communities in defining common monitoring challenges. In doing so, the IFM will not attempt to integrate components of Indigenous knowledge into science, but will instead aim to identify how the capacity, needs and viewpoints of circumpolar Indigenous Peoples can steer environmental monitoring work conducted in the Arctic and shape related decision-making processes.

By bringing together Indigenous elders, environmental practitioners, land managers and youth, the IFM will paint a comprehensive picture of the ability of Northerners to identify and respond to changes in their environment. The IFM's circumpolar linkages, supplemented by insight from the Pacific, will emphasize the human dimension of environmental change on Indigenous Peoples, and consequently the importance of environmental monitoring in the Arctic. The participation of social and natural science researchers in the IFM will also encourage the establishment of respectful connections between the holders of science-based and community-based knowledge.

The IFM will blend keynote speeches, roundtables and workshops in order to adequately address issues revolving around topics such as Indigenous knowledge, the continuation of cultural practices and livelihoods, participatory research, observational capacity and monitoring needs, and community-based monitoring.

More specifically, the insight of EoI ID No 100 will be sought in relation to monitoring needs on Indigenous lands, whereas the environmental baseline focus of EoI 496 will enhance discussions on observational capacity. Likewise, EoI 520 will bring legal expertise to debates surrounding Indigenous knowledge, EoI 922 will expand the IFM's coverage of community-based monitoring, EoI 503 will facilitate IFM's integration into the circumpolar observation and monitoring network, and EoI 1054 will strengthen the IFM's link to the Small Island Developing States. The IFM will draw from EoI 773's long-term ecosystem-based approach a means to merge scientific and Indigenous outlooks on the environment. Finally, the work of EoI 515 will help to illustrate how Indigenous environmental monitoring can influence governmental decision-making processes. 

The IFM will be held in concert with Northern Youth Abroad's youth policy forum (full proposal ID No 184), and as such will both provide an opportunity for, and be enhanced by, the involvement of northern youth.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: Wildlife stress
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=257

Arctic wildlife species have evolved unique physiologies and have developed life-history strategies for survival in the harsh polar environment. However, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment Report indicates that the climate is rapidly changing in the Arctic and has the potential to alter wildlife habitat, facilitate the northward migration of wildlife diseases and parasites, and alter contaminant cycling. It is imperative that we understand and predict the cumulative impacts that will arise from the multiple stressors associated with climate change. Unfortunately, we have few analytical tools that can be used to assess changes in the health and condition of arctic wildlife. For instance, little is known about the effects on northern wildlife of pathogens or parasites arriving in the arctic from temperate regions; especially under conditions of chronic exposure to low concentrations of immunosuppressive contaminants, nor do we currently have the research tools to study these potential impacts. Our ability to interpret the significance of health indices in arctic wildlife is hampered by a general lack of knowledge concerning the range of normal disease prevalence and pathological conditions. 
Wildlife populations are of great value to indigenous communities in the arctic as a source of country food and commercial harvests, as a draw for tourism, and as the cornerstone of cultural heritage and identity. Wildlife health assessment programs in the arctic can only be effective with the cooperation of communities that are in daily contact with wildlife and derive the benefits from utilization of this resource. There is a need to integrate traditional ecological knowledge with scientific research. Capacity building for research in communities in Canadas north is not only mandated by the Territorial governments, but is necessary for the success of a long-term assessment program. Northern communities must be empowered to make decisions that are necessary to mitigate the socio-economic and cultural impacts of these changes.
We propose to develop a research programme that will: 
i) Provide information on the health of arctic wildlife, using both scientific and traditional knowledge approaches. 
ii) Develop techniques to assess and predict changes in the health and condition of arctic wildlife exposed to multiple stressors.
iii) Build capacity within arctic communities to participate in the assessment of wildlife health and respond to changes in wildlife populations.
iv) Train research personnel to participate in research on multiple stressors in the arctic using community-based approaches.
The research partners will bring a variety of research approaches, national and international contacts and matching funds to this IPY project. We will build upon existing collaborative relationships, institutional strengths and agency mandates. This project will take on a coordinating role to manage the collection of animals, distribution of tissues, pooling of data and communications among the various research groups, agency partners and communities. Included in this coordinating activity will be sharing of samples with partners involved in related IPY projects. In order to focus our efforts, we will concentrate our research on a relatively small number of wildlife species, including polar bears ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas). These species were selected for their position within the food chain, their importance as a food for indigenous peoples and relative ease of collection by hunters. The projects that will support this research goal are:
I) Evaluating the health and condition of polar bears: 
There is a unique opportunity to build upon national and international collaborative linkages to describe the current health and condition of polar bears. The research team will use non-lethal sampling techniques to develop a profile of the health, condition, dietary status and contaminant burdens of polar bears, and identify biomarkers that are suitable for long-term assessment of the health of bears from several arctic and subarctic regions. 
II) Evaluating the health and condition of ringed seals and beluga whales:
We will work in communities in the circumpolar region to evaluate the health and condition of ringed seals and beluga whales. This work will require the cooperation of hunters in the participating communities to obtain samples from animals and to provide traditional knowledge of any perceived changes in animal condition and health. Information will include morphometric data and gross observations of putative pathological conditions provided by the hunters, analysis of pathological conditions and parasite burdens in the skin, liver, GI tract, kidney and adrenal glands, and data on various biomarkers of stress.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=92

The Southern Ocean is a key system in the global ocean with a crucial role in climate, biogeochemical cycles, maintaining food security and biodiversity. In recent years, some of the strongest regional expressions of global climate change have occurred in Antarctica. However, there is little information on the processes generating these changes, and the wider effects on marine ecosystems. There is a clear and increasing need to develop a coordinated circumpolar approach that assimilates and progresses understanding of climate variability and processes in the Southern Ocean, the implications for ecosystem dynamics, the impacts on biogeochemical cycles and the development of management procedures for the sustainable exploitation of living resources.

ICED is a new international multidisciplinary initiative launched in response to the increasing need to develop integrated circumpolar analyses of Southern Ocean climate and ecosystem dynamics.

ICED has been developed in conjunction with the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), through joint support from the Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Research (IMBER) and Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) programmes.

The ICED vision is to develop a coordinated circumpolar approach to better understand climate interactions in the Southern Ocean, the implications for ecosystem dynamics, the impacts on biogeochemical cycles, and the development of sustainable management procedures.

NACP Project Profile http://www.nacarbon.org/cgi-nacp/web/investigations/inv_pgp.pl?pgid=284


The goal is to continue investigating the effects of disturbance and interannual variation in climate on processes controlling carbon storage and the exchanges of energy, CO2, and water vapor in semi-arid and mesic coniferous forests at AmeriFlux sites in Oregon: the Metolius mature and young ponderosa pine sites (MP, YP), and the Marys River mature Douglas-fir site (MF). This is a cluster of supersites with measurements of ecosystem processes, eddy covariance, advection, and footprint modeling. 

Our objectives are to combine tower and ground-based observations at the semi-arid Metolius MP and YP to investigate effects of disturbance and interannual variation in climate on C storage and CO2 and water vapor exchange (disturbance gradient), and at the MF site for comparisons of response of mature semi-arid and mesic coniferous forests to seasonal and interannual variation in climate (climate gradient).

NACP Project Profile http://www.nacarbon.org/cgi-nacp/web/investigations/inv_pgp.pl?pgid=162

The problem:
 
The North American Carbon Program (NACP) is currently a major component of NASAs carbon cycle and ecosystem research focus. However, serving on, and interacting with, the NACP science steering group, as well as the ad-hoc group on Remote Sensing for NACP and the task force to coordinate NACPs mid-continent intensive campaign has made it clear that NASAs Earth Observing System (EOS) data products are not being used to their full potential within NACP. 

The solution:
 
NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center is operationally producing global product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This is done within the MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS). The related software operates on a cluster of multimission processing systems supporting several research teams. Two recent extensions of MODAPS, which were developed for archive and distribution of MODIS products, are the Atmospheres Archive and Distribution System (AADS) and the Land Archive and Distribution System (LADS). AADS and LADS offer new opportunities for custom processing and distribution of MODIS products. The goal of this proposal is to leverage, extend, and tailor the functionality available through AADS and LADS to serve the remote sensing needs of the North American Carbon Program as a: Data and Information Systems Support for Science Focus Areas and Applications. The purpose of these enhancements is to streamline access to MODIS atmosphere and land data products, to reduce data volume by providing only those data required by the user, and to improve the utility of data products. The proposed work will provide NACP investigators with a time series of MODIS products and custom preprocessing that will allow for direct ingest into an investigators modeling framework. By reducing the burden associated with ordering and pre-processing of MODIS products, we will enable NACP investigator to focus on the information content in MODIS data and its contribution to understanding carbon budgets. 

Anticipated Benefits:
 
This proposal will serve key researchers within the NACP who have an urgent need for enhanced support of MODIS data. The needs of this group will be representative of the larger climate modeling community and other land and atmosphere researchers; and the tools developed.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research (MCM LTER) Program is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study of the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in an ice-free region of Antarctica. MCM joined the National Science Foundation's LTER Network in 1993 and is funded through the Office of Polar Programs in six year funding periods. 

The McMurdo Dry Valleys are located on the western coast of McMurdo Sound (77°00'S 162°52'E) and form the largest relatively ice-free area (approximately 4800 square kilometers) on the Antarctic continent. These ice-free areas of Antarctica display a sharp contrast to most other ecosystems in the world, which exist under far more moderate environmental conditions. The perennially ice-covered lakes, ephemeral streams and extensive areas of exposed soil within the McMurdo Dry Valleys are subject to low temperatures, limited precipitation and salt accumulation. Thus, the dry valleys represent a region where life approaches its environmental limits, and is an "end-member" in the spectrum of environments included in the LTER Network. The dry valleys, unlike most other ecosystems, are dominated by microorganisms, mosses, lichens, and relatively few groups of invertebrates; higher forms of life are virtually non-existent. The original objectives of the McMurdo LTER were to understand the influence of physical and biological constraints on the structure and function of dry valley ecosystems and to understand the modifying effects of material transport on these ecosystems. Now in the third funding cycle, we are poised to answer more complex questions about biodiversity, the impact of climatic legacies, and ecosystem structure and function. 

Areas of research covered are meteorology, glaciology, streams, limnology and soil ecology.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      Background of Joint WMO/ICO Comission for Oceanography and
      Marine Meteorology (JCOMM):


As a step in the process of responding to new needs for marine
meteorological and oceanographic data, as expressed in particular by
the global observing systems (GOOS, GCOS, GTOS) as well as continuing
to serve the traditional users of such data and services, IOC and WMO
agreed to study the possibility of improved cooperation in the area of
marine data collection, analysis, integration, and
dissemination. These organizations have been cooperating for many
years and had jointly established the Integrated Global Ocean Services
System (IGOSS). The needs for the future demand even closer and more
effective cooperation.

The Executive Council (EC) of the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) (EC-XLVIII) in June 1996 and the Executive Council (EC) of the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) in October 1996
agreed that a study should be prepared on closer collaboration between
WMO and IOC with a view to possible co-sponsorship of the Commission
for Marine Meteorology (CMM) of WMO. A preliminary report was prepared
for the twelfth session of CMM in March 1997, which recommended that
the study be continued on closer cooperation between IOC and CMM and a
detailed proposal be prepared for the governing bodies of WMO and IOC.

WMO EC-XLIX in June 1997 approved this recommendation to continue with
a full and detailed study with a view to having a single, joint
WMO/IOC report available for consideration by the two ECs in 1998. The
19th session of the IOC Assembly in July 1997 endorsed the completion
of a joint study report for presentation to the 1998 EC session.

This background information contains a summary of the main discussion
and recommendations of the report prepared by joint IOC and WMO
consultants. The full report (in English only) will be available at
the session for consultation.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

The Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments
(IMPROVE) program is a cooperative measurement effort governed
by a steering committee composed of representatives from Federal
and regional-state organizations. The IMPROVE monitoring program
was established in 1985 to aid the creation of Federal and State
implementation plans for the protection of visibility in Class I
areas (156 national parks and wilderness areas) as stipulated in
the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act.

The objectives of IMPROVE are: 1. to establish current
visibility and aerosol conditions in mandatory class I areas (

2. to identify chemical species and emission sources responsible
for existing man-made visibility impairment

3. to document long-term trends for assessing progress towards
the national visibility goal

4. and with the enactment of the Regional Haze Rule, to provided
regional haze monitoring representing all visibility-protected
federal class I areas where practical.

IMPROVE has also been a key participant in visibility-related
research, including the advancement of monitoring
instrumentation, analysis techniques, visibility modeling,
policy formulation and source attribution field studies.

ASPeCt is a programme of multi-disciplinary Antarctic sea ice zone
research within the SCAR Global Change Programme. ASPeCt will
specifically address key identified deficiencies in our understanding
and data from the sea ice zone. The programme is designed to
complement and to contribute to the other international programmes in
this region and will build on existing and proposed research
programmes, and the shipping activities of National Antarctic
operators, and will also include a component of data-rescue of
valuable historical sea ice zone information.


The overall aim of ASPeCt is to understand and model the role of
Antarctic sea ice in the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system. This
requires an understanding of key processes, and the determination of
physical, chemical, and biological properties of the sea ice
zone. These are addressed by objectives which are:


I. To establish the distribution of the basic physical properties of
sea ice that are important to air-sea interaction and to biological
processes within the Antarctic sea-ice zone (ice and snow cover
thickness distributions; structural, chemical and thermal properties
of the snow and ice; upper ocean hydrography; floe size and lead
distribution). These data are required to derive forcing and
validation fields for climate models and to determine factors
controlling the biology and ecology of the sea ice-associated biota.


II. To understand the key sea-ice zone processes necessary for
improved parameterization of these processes in coupled models.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Santa Barbara Channel Study (SBCS) is the same as the Santa
Barbara Channel/Santa Marine Basin Study (SRC/SMB).

This study is an extension of the numerical modeling circulation
component of the Santa Barbara Channel-Santa Maria Basin (SBC-SMB)
Circulation Study. The SBC-SMB Circulation Study is the title of the
Cooperative Agreement (CA) between the state of California and the
MMS. Absence of sufficient observations, as has been the case in past
modeling programs, prevents proper model skill assessment. One of the
Scientific Review Panel?s April 1997 recommendations states that
successful SBC-SMB model development, successful analysis of
observations, and successful field work is contingent on all three
being performed concurrently during the conduct of the SBC-SMB
Circulation study. This will allow modelers valuable interaction with
the Study?s principal investigators (PI) (observationalists) during
the conduct of their respective study components.

Recent numerically modeled simulations of circulation processes
characteristic to the SBC have been, and continue to be, used in the
analysis of observations obtained in that area. Modeled simulations of
the characteristic flows of the SBC and SMB appropriate for OSRA, and
modeled circulation processes helpful to analysis of the data obtained
in the SMB, are not scheduled for completion under the present
contract.

      Objectives:

      1. Support analysis of observations obtained from the extended
      field work with numerically modeled process studies presently
      taking place in the Santa Maria Basin.

      2. Provide reliable predicted ocean current information for the
      Santa Barbara Channel and the SMB by complementing the entire
      suite of observations obtained in the SBC-SMB Circulation Study.

This project is aimed to achieve a higher knowledge of the limnetic systems in Polar latitudes. Particularly, it promotes the accurate description the Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island), considered one of the most important freshwater zones in the Maritime Antarctica, as well as Deception Island. This project is related to an international Polar Latitudinal Gradient aimed at understanding the effects of the environmental variables related with latitude (temperature and radiation) on the biodiversity of the freshwater ecosystems, and also modelling the effects of the Global Climate Change on these kind of ecosystems. This proposal involves scientists from different institutions with extensive expertise on the organisms that will be found in these ecosystems. Moreover, this proposal is closely linked with other groups from overseas, this fact will allow an exchange, both of scientists and data collected from the different ecosystems, representing an evident benefit in the production and validation of models.

El presente proyecto pretende aumentar el conocimiento de los ecosistemas limnéticos en las zonas polares. En particular se espera describir con precisión la Península Byers (Isla Livingston) una de las zonas de ecosistemas dulceacuícolas más importantes de la Antártida Marítima, así como Isla Decepción. Este proyecto a su vez participa de un gradiente latitudinal polar en cooperación con otros programas polares internacionales con doble objetivo: por un lado estudiar las variaciones en biodiversidad en estos ecosistemas acuáticos, lo que permitirá entender como las variaciones ambientales asociadas a la latitud (radiación y temperatura) afectan a la diversidad biológica; y por otro lado pretende pronosticar las variaciones ecológicas que experimentarán los ecosistemas polares en un evento de cambio climático global. El estudio aquí propuesto incorpora especialistas, procedentes de distintos centros de investigación, en los distintos aspectos que se investigarán referentes a los ecosistemas acuáticos y cuenta con una importante componente internacional que permitirá un intercambio de investigadores y de datos obtenidos en los distintos ecosistemas polares investigados, con sus evidentes beneficios a la hora de producción de modelos.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">The Bering Strait, Rapid Change, and Land Bridge Paleoecology</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Bering Strait connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans via the Arctic Ocean. The Strait is currently only 50 meters deep. During low sea level stands produced by continental glaciation it was emergent, forming the Bering Land Bridge connection between North America and Asia. This is the only area on Earth where the circulation between ocean basins has been blocked and a migration corridor between continental landmasses has been opened by falling sea levels of the Pleistocene epoch. Scientific drilling to recover a proximal record of the region can be most promisingly recovered in the thick (&gt; 3 km) basinal sequences of the Norton and Hope basins immediately to the south and north of the Strait. The sedimentary record of marine transgressions and regressions within the Bering Strait region that includes intercalated terrestrial lacustrine sediments would have the potential to resolve crucial questions regarding Bering Land Bridge paleoecology and climate change.
Funds to conduct a workshop to identify, select and prioritize drilling sites in Bering Sea Shelf basins with the potential to contain thick sequences of alternating marine and terrestrial sediments was approved by Joint Oceanographic Institutions/United States Science Support Program (JOI/USSSP) . Workshop to be held 21-222 June, 2005. The workshop focused on key scientific questions, identification of drilling sites with the potential to answer these questions, discussing the most appropriate platform or platforms, proposal submissions, and multi-proxy analyses. Products of this workshop will include a discussion of the potential scientific gains, a list of recommended drilling sites, and, ultimately, proposals submitted to the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.
Scientific issues included: Studies of global freshwater transport have demonstrated a net flux of water from the North Pacific to the North Atlantic through the Bering Strait at a rate of 0.8 Sverdrups per year which accounts for nearly one-third of the total freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean . Models indicate that increased flow of fresher North Pacific water through the submerged Bering Strait can also lead to suppression of NADW formation . The opening and closing of the Bering Strait clearly has global climatic implications with regard to the cause and the duration of glacial and interglacial climatic oscillations, yet the numerous and sometimes contradictory models cannot be adequately tested because an accurate chronology of the emergence and submergence of the Strait is lacking. Reconstruction of the sea level history of the Bering Strait, including the exact timing of the opening and closing of the land bridge and the rates of associated sea level changes, the presence/absence of sea/terrestrial ice, is essential to understanding its role as a trigger or pacemaker of northern hemisphere climate changes. The Bering Land Bridge served as an oscillating biological filter between marine and terrestrial for plants, animals, and humans that passed between Eurasia and North America during the Late Quaternary period. Previous exchanges of species between Asia and North America during the Miocene and Late Cretaceous indicate that the Bering Strait region experienced intervals of emergence prior to the Pleistocene. Intercontinental exchange and competition from foreign species has been sited as a causal factor in the Cretaceous, Eocene, and Pleistocene extinctions. It needs to be determined if there was a north-south and/or east west ecological gradient on the central land bridge? If so did the gradients varied in space and time?
In addition to organic remains, identification and dating of tephras contained within terrestrial or marine sediments of the Bering Strait will further enhance understanding of the chronology of Quaternary eruptions and their role in global climate variations. Geochemical characterization of tephras from Bering Strait cores could provide a record of the frequency, magnitude, and timing of eruptions at volcanoes of the Aleutian Arc, Seward Peninsula, and islands in Bering Sea. Furthermore, volcanic ash deposits are one of the only possible ways of demonstrating precise correlations between terrestrial and marine deposits throughout Beringia and the Bering Sea.
. The workshop participants resolved that in order to address unresolved questions regarding global ocean circulation and rapid climate changes, and to permit reconstruction of the flora, fauna, and climate of the lowlands in the center of the Beringian subcontinent, basinal features that contain both marine and terrestrial lacustrine sediments must be targeted

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NASA space science missions have ventured to the moon, explored other planets, traveled to the edges of our solar system, and peered back in time. They have also done what is sometimes even more difficult - studied our own planet, Earth.
 
These missions have provided astounding views of the universe and new knowledge of our solar system, but there is still so much more to "see" and learn. And, as missions become progressively more daring, and thus more difficult, more advanced capabilities are needed. However, before new, untried technologies are used for the first time on complex exploration missions, engineers and scientists want to make sure they will operate well, and safely, in the hazardous environment of space. 

To accomplish this, NASA's Office of Space Science (OSS) and Office of Earth Science jointly established the New Millennium Program (NMP) in 1995 - an ambitious, exciting vision to speed up space exploration through the development and testing of leading-edge technologies. A unique program, managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, NMP provides a critical bridge from initial concept to exploration-mission use. Through NMP, selected technologies are demonstrated in the "laboratory" of space that can't be replicated on Earth.

Since its inception over a decade ago, NMP has validated many innovative technologies for both Earth science and space science missions. Now funded and managed solely out of NASA's newly formed Science Mission Directorate (SMD), the Program continues to demonstrate advanced technologies that will enable space science missions of the 21st century with significant (a several-generation leap) technical capabilities.

Highly advanced technologies are key to more capable, powerful, and efficient spacecraft and science instruments. They are also key to gathering new and exciting scientific knowledge of our solar system and of our universe.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Grapevine Remote Sensing Analysis of Phylloxera Early Stress</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      Problem:

California winegrape cultivation is vital to the State's economy and
provides the main support for the nation's &amp;#3612 billion retail
wine industry. In 1994 the wine industry provided 194,000 direct jobs
nationally, with total wages of &amp;#363.5 billion. Tax assessments
on wine remitted &amp;#361.6 billion to federal, state and local
governments (source: Barsby &amp; Associates).

Since the late 1980's, California wine growers have been faced with
destruction of their vines by infestation of a root louse named
phylloxera (biotype B). The louse kills vines by feeding on their
roots. There is no way to eradicate the pest, and infested areas must
eventually be replanted on a phylloxera-resistant or tolerant
rootstock. The infestation is present in eight California counties,
and is particularly severe in Napa and Sonoma Counties where thousands
of acres of premiere vineyards have already been destroyed or are
scheduled for future replacement.

      Approach:

During the 1993-1995 time period, NASA Ames Research Center (Ecosystem
Science and Technology Branch) collaborated with industry and
university partners to develop and transfer the use of remote sensing
and associated computerized technologies as a tool for vineyard
managers to use in addressing the phylloxera problem. NASA's partners
on this project included the University of California Cooperative
Extension (Napa County), University of California Davis (Entomology
Dept.), California State University Chico (School of Agriculture) and
the Robert Mondavi Winery. Staff from each organization brought unique
expertise to the project, working together in the field, laboratory
and computer room. The work was co-funded by NASA's Office of Advanced
Concepts and Technology and the Robert Mondavi Winery. Project results
are being made available to the wine industry, commercial remote
sensing product vendors, agricultural community and general public
through invited oral presentations!  and written reports.  The
typically rapid progression of phylloxera infestation was
characterized for the 1989-1993 time period across a ~1000 acre
Mondavi property using retrospective color infrared aerial
photography.

During the 1993 growing season, field and aircraft data were collected
from Napa Valley test sites with special sensors designed to study
earth resources, including plant stress manifested as reductions in
vegetation canopy density. Infestations are detectable in this
remotely sensed imagery, even in the early stage when phylloxera are
underground eating vine roots but the above ground plant still appears
healthy.

      Significance:

By using remote sensing and associated analysis techniques, growers
can attain earlier knowledge on the rate of spread of the infestation,
and the rate of decline for affected vines. It is anticipated that
this source of information will allow for more informed replanting
decisions, helping California wineries retain market share.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The United States Joint Global Ocean Flux Study was a national component of international JGOFS and an integral part of global climate change research.

The U.S. launched the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) in the late 1980s to study the ocean carbon cycle. An ambitious goal was set to understand the controls on the concentrations and fluxes of carbon and associated nutrients in the ocean. A new field of ocean biogeochemistry emerged with an emphasis on quality measurements of carbon system parameters and interdisciplinary field studies of the biological, chemical and physical process which control the ocean carbon cycle. As we studied ocean biogeochemistry, we learned that our simple views of carbon uptake and transport were severely limited, and a new "wave" of ocean science was born. U.S. JGOFS has been supported primarily by the U.S. National Science Foundation in collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Energy and the Office of Naval Research. U.S. JGOFS, ended in 2005 with the conclusion of the Synthesis and Modeling Project (SMP).

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Polar Disturbance and Ecosystem Services: Links between Climate and Human Well-being</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The goal of this project is to document pan-arctic changes in large-scale disturbances (thermokarst, fire, insect outbreaks, and forest harvest), relate these to climatic and social change, and to assess their ecological, climatic, and societal consequences in high-latitude ecosystems (tundra and boreal forest). Recent trends suggest that continued high-latitude warming will likely be accompanied by increases in disturbances such as fire, insect outbreaks, thermokarst, and potentially forest harvest and land-cover conversion to grassland or agriculture. These disturbances have qualitatively different effects on the climate system, ecological processes, and therefore society than do those ecological processes that are more continuous functions of climatic change. Large-scale disturbances have the practical advantage that they can be quantified regionally by remote sensing so processes studied locally are more readily extrapolated to large scales. The program builds on existing research programs in Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia and on global remote-sensing and inventory programs. We choose a pan-arctic scale so we can relate our results to the functioning of arctic climate system and take advantage of geographic variation in climate and disturbance regime. We also build from national and site-based research programs and databases, providing the opportunity to link processes and local, regional, and global scales. We address the following questions:
1. How have changes in climate affected disturbance regime across the arctic and boreal zones, and how have these changes in disturbance affected climate through changes in trace gas emissions, smoke, and energy exchange? Do feedbacks from land-surface processes to climate buffer or amplify the initial climate trends? In other words, what is the net effect of these high-latitude climate feedbacks on the global climate system? We currently have circumboreal databases of disturbances (fire, insects, and forest harvest), vegetation, climate (1900-2005; projected to 2100), and date of snowmelt, providing the datasets necessary to make preliminary estimates of high-latitude climate feedbacks. National programs will refine and improve these databases and develop climatic, geographic, and socioeconomic correlations as a basis for developing rules to estimate future disturbance rates.
2. How do changes in disturbance regime affect post-disturbance ecosystem development and future disturbance probability? Are there thresholds in disturbance severity or size that trigger qualitatively different patterns of ecosystem development? For example, are there conditions where fire at treeline or insect outbreaks at the southern margin of the boreal forest lead to a permanent land-cover transition? We will rely on regional studies to develop simple models of post-disturbance succession for fire, logging, insects, and agriculture. We are particularly interested in circumstances that trigger radically different vegetation succession such as wet tundra to shrub tundra; tundra to forest; conifer to deciduous forest; or forest to grassland. Based on preliminary studies, we are confident we can develop these models.
3. How have changes in disturbance regime and resulting changes in ecosystem structure and functioning affected ecosystem services on which society depends, and how have human activities (ignitions, suppression, and land-cover change) influenced the response of disturbance regime to climatic change? Many ecosystem services (timber, fuelwood, berries, moose, caribou, etc.) can be estimated from the interactive effects of climate and vegetation (stand type and age). Based on maps of climate and vegetation (#1) and disturbance frequency and successional trajectory (#2), we can estimate temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem services. Based on local and regional studies we can estimate the validity of these estimates and the extent to which they are influenced by other factors such as human harvest. We will then explore the social, economic and cultural bases for these human impacts on ecosystem services.
4. How have policies changed in response to recent changes in climate and disturbance regime, and what factors influence the rigidity or flexibility of these policies and therefore the potential for adaptation or vulnerability at times of rapid change? Based on the patterns described above we will develop alternative scenarios of future ecosystem services (climate feedbacks and subsistence resources). We will explore with residents and policy makers policies that might influence the relative likelihood of these alternative scenarios.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Project Information : 
The Tropical Instability Wave Expreiment (TIWE) is a multi- institutional, multi-investigator program aimed at furthering our understanding of planetary waves, resulting from surface current instability near the equator, which affect the upper ocean balances of mass, momentum, and heat. The Tropical Instability Wave Experiment (TIWE) consists of several elements, one of which was an array of five subsurface moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), centered on the equator at 140°E. 



Field Program : 
The TIWE field program consisted of several elements, including : 1) an array of subsurface acoustic Doppler current profiliers (ADCPs) centered on the equator at 140°W, 2) an array of subsurface moored mechanical profilers for currents, temperature, and salinity centered upon 2°N, 140°W, 3) shipboard hydrographic measurements to map out the property fields associated with these waves and 4) a remote sensing component mapping surface expressions by satellite. The field work associated with this project was initiated in May 1990 and lasted for approximately one year. The University of South Florida (USF), College of Marine Science contribution to this field program is the deployment of five subsurface moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), centered on the equator at 140°E in a diamond shaped array.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Scientists with myriad backgrounds and Inuit elders with traditional knowledge will integrate results , insights and observations to explain the expression of teeth in the narwhal. The extraordinary tusk defies most of the principles and properties of teeth and remains a scientific enigma. Findings about its form and function will add to the evolutionary knowledge for this odd adaptation and will, because of unique findings of anatomy and histology recently discovered by this team, further define sensory capabilities of mammalian teeth. Scientific results have already begun to direct interest in future models of dental material design as the hard tissue of the narwhal tusk possesses a combination of unusual flexibility and strength characteristics that is highly desirable in restorative materials. These same tusk traits were observed by the Inuit before the laboratory testing was completed, and the results were reported. Likewise, traditional knowledge elucidates many aspects of narwhal anatomy, function, migration and social behavior. Both the knowledge of Inuit elders and the findings of scientists are needed for a more complete understanding of the narwhal, Qilalugaq qernertaq.

Scientific studies in anatomy, morphology, histology, physiology, genetics, cellular biology and narwhal social behavior are currently being conducted by the principal investigator and collaborators to elucidate tusk function. Anatomical variations of narwhal will be described from field and laboratory dissection, computerized scans (CT, MRI and micro-CT), analysis of museum specimens, and interviews with Inuit elders. Photographic morpho-metric analysis of narwhal skeletal collections at the Museum of Nature in Canada, Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, the Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History has been initiated, and we are seeking other institutions that may have additional collections, particularly those with rare specimens. Anatomic plates of narwhal anatomy will be completed based on all these collected findings.

On October 28, 2006, a panel discussion was presented by the principal investigator, Paniloo Sangoya and David Angnatsiak from the community of Pond Inlet at the 15th International Inuit Studies Conference in Paris, France. Future joint presentations with the principal investigator and Inuit elders will be encouraged and planned to express the value of scientific collaboration with Inuit elders in marine mammal research.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The LAzarev Sea KRIll Study (LAKRIS) aims to quantify seasonal population dynamics and physiological condition of krill with an interdisciplinary approach, in a region of the Antarctic that is poorly sampled and understood.

Much of our knowledge of Antarctic krill comes from a few regions, such as the much-studied Antarctic Peninsula (Hofmann et al. 2004). But it is becoming increasingly clear that the seasonal survival mechanisms of krill are variable, so neither the local environment, (e.g. those along the Antarctic Peninsula) nor the response of krill to it, can be extrapolated easily to a wider area. The LAKRIS project will complement the existing international research activities within SO-GLOBEC and CCAMLR along the west Antarctic Peninsula, Scotia Sea and in the Southwest Indian Ocean Sector (Hofmann et al. 2004, Atkinson 2003, Nicol et al. 2000).

The aim of the European Union's Coordination of Information on
the Environment (CORINE) project is to provide up to date
information on land cover at scale 1:100.000 for the whole
Europe. The database includes 44 categories in accordance with a
standard European nomenclature, organised into five large groups:
artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forest and semi-natural
areas, wetlands, water bodies. Classification was done by visual
interpretation using Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite image maps
with the help of topographic maps as main ancillary material and
field work. Following digitization the land cover information is
stored in topological structure as ARC/INFO database.

The project started in 1993 in Hungary together with the
neighbouring Central and East European countries and finished for
Hungary in 1996. The final product has been integrated into the
European database and is available for users. Printed maps
covering the whole country were produced at scales 1:500.000 and
1:200.000.

An experimental project to derive similar land cover at scale
1:50.000 was also carried out for selected areas. An experimental
CORINE Land Cover?Level 4 nomenclature was formulated for Central
Europe by experts of the participating countries (Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland and Slovakian) including 87 categories. Mapping
was based on digitally merged Landsat TM and SPOT PAN satellite
imagery. Two larger blocks have been mapped (Bükk-Nyírség and
Kiskunság) covering about 15% of the country.

Radionuclides can serve as valuable tracers of atmospheric and terrestrial transport processes, which will be altered by changing climate patterns. This project is anchored in the existing Health Canada radiological monitoring network operated throughout Canada. The network includes seven Arctic sites equipped with high volume samplers for airborne particulates. Two of these sites are also equipped for noble gas collection and one site is equipped with a continuous gamma radiation monitor. In addition to the primary functions of supporting of the Canadian Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan and the international Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the network provides regular measurements of a wide range of naturally-occurring radionuclide concentrations in air. Heavy metals and some organic compounds will also be measured in airborne particulates collected by the air samplers. An archive of air filters extending back to the early 1970s will allow the elucidation of time trends in these contaminants. The Health Canada air monitoring network covers an area extending from 55o to 83o North Latitude and 60o to 135o West Longitude, representing a large fraction of the entire land mass in the North polar region. 

Data from the Canadian network will supplemented with similar data collected by collaborators in other countries -notably Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. Ground-based sample collections will also be carried out in the Canadian north to gain a better understanding of the deposition of atmospheric contaminants and their movement through food chains leading to humans.

The objectives of this project are:
-Establish an international database for sharing data between monitoring networks in collaborating countries.
-Develop and extend atmospheric transport models to trace the movement of radionuclides and other contaminants from sources in temperate zones to remote Arctic locations
-Demonstrate changing trends in atmospheric circulation to the Arctic and within the Arctic by using these contaminants as tracers of atmospheric processes. 
-Document changes in soil gas emanation due to changing permafrost conditions.
-Examine the link between climate change and forest fires in the north
-Contribute to an understanding of ozone depletion in the stratosphere and ozone chemistry at ground level.
-Assess the impact of these changes on the movement of contaminants through Arctic ecosystems and particularly in food chains leading to humans.

The following ongoing and future studies will be carried out with the aid of air monitoring networks for radionuclides and other contaminants:
-A study carried out in collaboration with Meteorological Services of Canada has traced the movement of iodine-129 from nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in Siberia to remote locations in the Canadian Arctic. 
-Radioxenon from the reactor belt in eastern North America has been traced to Yellowknife, NWT. Measurements will be extended to include the long-lived krypton-85, a waste product from nuclear fuel reprocessing, in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions.
-Cesium-137 released from wood-burning in distant forest fires has been detected at the Yellowknife location. Levoglucosan, a combustion product from forest fires, will also be measured on archived air filters to provide an historical record of forest fire effects. 
-Measurements of uranium, radium, lead-210, and potassium-40, and total dust loading will give information on intercontinental dust transport.
-The short-lived radon and thoron decay products (lead-212, bismuth-214) are indicative of local emanations of soil gas and will be used to study changing permafrost conditions. 
-The beryllium isotopes (Be-7 and Be-10) are produced by cosmic irradiation of air molecules in the stratosphere. Their abundances and ratios at the earth's surface give information on exchanges of air masses between the stratosphere and troposphere, which are vulnerable to changing climate conditions.
-Measurements of heavy metals (e.g., Hg, Cd) and selected organic compounds will extend the range of sources and pathways that can be studied and will aid in the understanding of atmospheric chemistry processes in the Arctic. 

Details are still being worked out on the ground based studies. They will include collections of precipitation, soil, lichens, and higher plants to track the deposition of airborne contaminants and their movement through the food chain.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">EOS</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Earth Observing System</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Earth Observing System (EOS) is the centerpiece of NASA's Earth
Science Enterprise (ESE). It consists of a science component and a
data system supporting a coordinated series of polar-orbiting and low
inclination satellites for long-term global observations of the land
surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. By enabling
improved understanding of the Earth as an integrated system, the EOS
program has benefits for us all. The EOS Project Science Office
(EOSPSO) is committed to helping bring program information and
resources to program scientists and the general public alike.

EOS Program Description:

Since its creation in 1958, NASA has been studying the Earth and its
changing environment by observing the atmosphere, oceans, land, ice,
and snow, and their influence on climate and weather. We now realize
that the key to gaining a better understanding of the global
environment is exploring how the Earth's systems of air, land, water,
and life interact with each other. This approach -- called Earth
System Science -- blends together fields like meteorology,
oceanography, biology, and atmospheric science.

In 1991, NASA launched a more comprehensive program to study the Earth
as an environmental system, now called the Earth Science
Enterprise. By using satellites and other tools to intensively study
the Earth, we hope to expand our understanding of how natural
processes affect us, and how we might be affecting them. Such studies
will yield improved weather forecasts, tools for managing agriculture
and forests, information for fishermen and local planners, and,
eventually, the ability to predict how the climate will change in the
future.

The Earth Science Enterprise has three main components: a series of
Earth-observing satellites, an advanced data system, and teams of
scientists who will study the data. Key areas of study include clouds;
water and energy cycles; oceans; chemistry of the atmosphere; land
surface; water and ecosystem processes; glaciers and polar ice sheets;
and the solid Earth.

Phase I of the Earth Science Enterprise had been comprised of focused,
free-flying satellites, Space Shuttle missions, and various airborne
and ground-based studies. Phase II began in December of 1999 with the
launch of the first Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite, Terra
(formerly AM-1) and Landsat 7. EOS is the first observing system to
offer integrated measurements of the Earth's processes. It consists of
a science component and a data system supporting a coordinated series
of polar-orbiting and low-inclination satellites for long-term global
observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere,
and oceans. We have initiated an era of unprecedented observational
capability for understanding the planet.

Just as the first weather and communications satellites fundamentally
changed our way of thinking about those fields, so the elements of the
Earth Science Enterprise will expand our perspective of the global
environment and climate. Working together with our partners around the
world, we are well on our way to improving our knowledge of the Earth
and using that knowledge to the benefit of all humanity.

The passenger jet of the future is taking shape. NASA and its
industry partners have developed a concept for a next-generation
supersonic passenger jet that would fly 300 passengers at more
than 1,500 miles per hour (more than twice the speed of
sound). As envisioned, the High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT)
would cross the Pacific or Atlantic in less than half the time
of modern subsonic jets, and at a ticket price less than 20
percent above comparable, slower flights.

Technology to make the HSCT possible is being developed as part
of NASA's High-Speed Research (HSR) program. The HSR program,
begun in 1990, is supported by a team of U.S. aerospace
companies. The international economic stakes are high. The
projected market for more than 500 HSCTs between the years 2000
and 2015 translates to more than &amp;#36200 billion in sales,
and the potential of 140,000 new jobs in the United States.

*** NOTE: The NASA High-Speed Research (HSR) Program was phased
    out in fiscal year 1999 ***

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), is a space based instrument used to detect the distribution and variability of total lightning (cloud-to-cloud, intracloud, and cloud-to-ground lightning) that occurs in the tropical regions of the globe. The LIS is a science instrument aboard the TRMM Observatory, which was launched on 28 November 1997 from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan. 

This lightning sensor consists of a staring imager which is optimized to locate and detect lightning with storm-scale resolution (4 to 7 km) over a large region (600 x 600 km) of the Earth&amp;#039;s surface. The TRMM Satellite travels a distance of 7 kilometers every second (nearly 16,000 miles per hour) as it orbits the Earth, thus allowing the LIS to observe a point on the Earth or a cloud for almost 90 seconds as it passes overhead. Despite the brief duration of an observation, it is long enough to estimate the flashing rate of most storms. The instrument records the time of occurrence, measures the radiant energy, and determines the location of lightning events within its field-of-view.

For example, biologists sampling fish species often use GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates to locate habitats on maps. If their maps arent completely accurate, they might place fish in the wrong water body. That could be a serious problem if, for example, they are trying to identify rivers that support populations of threatened or endangered species. When the scientists Lehner worked with wondered whether this problem could be solved, he recalls, Everyone said, Not really. We dont have good enough maps. But now they suddenly do. Using HydroSHEDS, conservation biologists can pinpoint species habitats with unprecedented accuracy.

Project URL: http://www.arcticpeoples.org/key-issues/monitoring/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=247

This project will create an infrastructure for monitoring and observation by the indigenous and other Arctic residents organizations based in the coastal communities of the Bering Sea region (BSR) including Bering Strait and adjacent Chukchi Sea. It will increase capacity and effectiveness of the circum-Arctic monitoring through responding to the need of the long-term collection of data in remote Arctic locations, in particularly, in BSR that was identified as a priority monitoring area by many scientists, e.g. by the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme of the Arctic Council. The project will use IPY as an impetus to consolidate current research and jump-start new cooperative activities between scientists, indigenous and other citizens groups from the North East Russia and Alaska, U.S. Whereas, the region is known for an international cooperative research in specific species management, e.g. Gray whales and Polar bear, efforts on creation of circum-Bering Sea research interface have not been successful due to political and logistical reasons. BSSN will work specifically with community-based/place based research and will attempt to integrate these efforts with broader scientific activities in the region and globally.
BSSN will consist of community-based and/or international regional organizations, primarily indigenous. In addition to the international organization (AIA, ICC, CAFF, UNEP), the list of initial partners will include five Alaska Natives regional non-profit organizations, eight regional organizations in Chukotka and Kamchatka in Russia, Alaska Native Science Commission and University of Alaska. The Network will cooperate with other organizations, projects and scientists from the cluster projects. The initial program activities will be based on the existing and emerging research and monitoring projects implemented by its partners. Examples of potential monitoring targets related to climate change, biodiversity and human health: shift of southern species north, changes in distribution and abundance of fish and other temperature-sensitive species, change in ice patterns, weather observations, contaminants presence in environment and traditional foods, weather related accidents, occurrence of infectious diseases.
The research activities that are currently undertaken in cooperation with scientists will continue in BSSN. This project will advance this work by scaling it up to the international level. It will create a system for sharing of the best practices of individual projects/organizations in the region and in the Arctic, will enable scientists to reach key areas in the region for collection of specific data and will improve standardized data management. 
The Network will employ the following principles: ecosystem approach BSSN has ecosystem boundaries and the collected data will help better understand relationships between various elements of ecosystem; openness and transparency based on defined structure and management; use of the best available knowledge - western science and expertise derived from traditional and indigenous knowledge will be utilized. Local and indigenous experts, recognized as such in their respective communities, will be offered an opportunity to work side-by-side with scientists contributing to generate hypotheses, analyze empirical data, develop and perform research activities where appropriate. The network will consist of organizations, not projects, to ensure sustainability and continuity. 
In 2006, BSSN will conduct a series of workshops to devise the Network management structure, logistics, memberships and means for sustainability. Work plans for activities assuring BSSN input to major IPY projects (CBMP, AHHI, and ESSAS via BEST and SEARCH, etc.) and output from independent thematic projects, e.g. ALISON, will be developed. A data management process will be established for the network. Alaska Native Science Commission and the University of Alaska will lead this work. The process will go through rigorous reviews by BSSN members and will conform to the standards/matrix developed by IPY data management services. 
Initial research activities may begin in 2006 with thematic observation systems based on current projects and will continue in 2007-08 with inclusion of new monitoring projects, e.g. invasive species or distribution of particular species. Such thematic networks could be developed for CBMP and other interested programs. The list of current projects includes: 1.) Oil spill monitoring, lead partner (LP) Aleutian Pribilof Island Association (APIA), funded; 2.) Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning, LP Aleut International Association, funding pending; 3.) Shark distribution changes, LP APIA, funding pending; 4.)Traditional food safety, LP APIA; 5.) Polar bear and whale hunting projects of the Alaska Chukotka development Program

high-frequency gas chromatographic measurements of methane (CH4);
nitrous oxide (N2O), Chloroflurocarbons CFCl3 (CFC-11), CF2Cl2
(CFC-12), and CF2ClCFC12 (CFC-113); methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3); and
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).  The network includes observation
stations situated at different sites throughout the world: Cape Grim,
Tasmania; Point Matatula, American Samoa; Ragged Point, Barbados; and
Mace Head, Ireland; and Trinidad Head, California.  Stations existed
at Cape Meares, Oregon and Adrigole, Ireland. The GAGE is the second
phase of a monitoring network consisting of the Atmospheric Lifetime

The Global Emissions Inventory Activity is an activity of the
International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Core project of the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Program. GEIA was orgnaized at the
Seventh International Symposium of the Commission on the Atmospheric
Chemistry and Global Pollution (CACGP) in Chamrousse, France, in
September 1990.

GEIA is one of the activities that has been defined by the IGAC
Steering Committee and its efforts include:
. estabishing a framework for developing and evaluating global
emissions inventories
. conducting a critical survey of existing emissions inventories of
compounds of major importance in global atmospheric chemistry
. generating and publishing inventories for use by scientists worldwide

The ultimate goal of GEIA is to establish emissions inventories for
all trace gases of interest, incorporating fluxes from both
anthropogenic and natural sources.
The current focus of GEIA is to make global emissions available on a
one degree grid for the entire world. The reference year for which
data is being collected is 1990. The following emissions inventories
are planned:
NOx - nitrogen oxide
SO2 - sulfur dioxide
VOC - volatile organic compounds (isoprene,terpene,other)
CO2 - carbon dioxide
Pb  - lead
CFC - chlorofluorocarbons
NH3 - ammonia
N2O - nitrous oxide
CH4 - methane
CO  - carbon monoxide
Hg  - mercury
Organochlorines
Radionuclides
Biomass burning
Aircraft emissions

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Arctic will experience some of the more dramatic environmental changes in the 21st century as surface air temperatures continue to rise in response to anthropogenic forcing. This will lead to an intensification of the Arctic hydrologic cycle. At regional scales, however, it remains unknown how precipitation, evaporation, and river discharge are evolving in a warmer world. This study will investigate the role of large-scale atmospheric anomalies in the Canadian northern hydrologic cycle with a focus on the IPY. Specifically, we will address the following science questions:

1) What are the dominant large-scale atmospheric teleconnections that affect northern Canada?
2) What is the role of these teleconnections and their relative contributions to the atmospheric and surface water budgets of high-latitude river basins in a changing environment?
3) How will the meteorological and hydrological variables differ from their mean state during the IPY and how will they evolve in the near future?

To answer these important science questions, the following work will be conducted according to the proposed timeline:

-2006-2007: Historical meteorological and hydrological data will be analysed. Relationships between atmospheric teleconnections such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the state of the hydrologic budget over northern Canada will be evaluated. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA40) data set will provide global meteorological data that will be supplemented by observed river discharge from the Canadian Hydrometric Database (HYDAT) and observed precipitation and temperature from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia. The analysis will cover the period 1964-2004 for which spatial and temporal coverage is best and focus on the Mackenzie and Hudson Bay river basins.

-2007-2008: During the IPY intensive observing period, real-time monitoring of the atmospheric teleconnection indexes and of the hydrologic budget in northern Canada will be maintained. The daily and recent state of atmospheric and hydrologic variables, including daily assessments of their deviations from the mean, will be reported on our website to provide other researchers this valuable information.

-2008-2009: A diagnostic study of the atmospheric and hydrologic state over northern Canada during the IPY will be conducted. This work will focus on the anomalies during the IPY from the mean state (1964-2004). An assessment of trends in the atmospheric teleconnection indexes and in the hydrometeorological variables will provide insights on the possible future state of northern Canada’s hydrologic cycle.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=276

Last decades saw the important changes in Arctic archaeology witnessing new significant discoveries of surprisingly early sites located at Northwestern Europe and East Siberia. The new data led to the radical revision of traditional views on the initial human dispersal and adaptations in High Latitudes. The schemes presented and repeated in manuals and textbooks are essential wrong and outdated. In spite of the unprecedented scale of field activity in different portions of this vast area, the projects are conducted by the individual and occasionally isolated regional research groups. It hampers the co-operation of scholars and coordination between field and laboratory research. To address these challenges during the International Polar Year, we have developed a new research programme known as ICOL - the Initial Human Colonization of Arctic in Changing Palaeoenvironments. Only by integrating results from archaeological and palaeoenvironmental studies will it be possible to develop a comprehensive understanding of Early Man dispersal and adaptations in extremely harsh conditions of Arctic and Subarctic. The territory of the Northern Eurasia is of prime importance for the comparative study of early human dispersal and adaptations. The glacial activity during the Late Pleistocene in this part of world was restricted (comparing with northern part of North America and some portions of the Southern Hemisphere occupied by giant glacial sheets) and vast areas allowed the rapid human dispersal. Moreover, this territory played a key role in human colonization of the Western Hemisphere via Beringia. The comprehensive studies of man-land relationships in the Upper Paleolithic will be carried out in several regions of the Eastern portion of the European Russia, the territories lying near the Ural Mountains and the Pechora River basin (Byzovaya, Garchi, Zaozerye and Mamontova Kurya), as well as in Eastern Siberia (the Yana RHS site). The study of the Early Man in the New World is of particular interest connected with the complicated history of the Bering Land Bridge. In this connection the study of the muliticomponent site of Broken Mammoth (interior Alaska) is of crucial importance. The study of late human penetration to High Latitudes in Holocene during the Ocean transgression is of no less importance. In this connection the Mesolithic and Neolithic sites located at the northern most part of Kola Peninsular, Novosibisk Islands (the Zhokhov Island site), Chukotka (the Tytyl and Elgygtgyn lake sites), and coastal north Greenland (Kap Ole Cheiwitz, Kolnaes) will be main targets of research. The study of hunter-gatherers subsistence and adaptations will be supplemented by palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, including the studies of glacial activity, permafrost, vegetation and fauna. The starting points of migrated populations, possible migration routes and time will be defined. The chronological framework of the project will embrace different epochs from the Eemian Interglacial (phase 5e) to the Holocene.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Atmospheric aerosols, or fine particles, are one of the greatest
sources of uncertainty in the interpretation and prediction of
global climate change. Natural variations of aerosols,
especially due to episodic eruptions of large volcanos, are
recognized as a significant climate forcing, that is, a factor
that alters the planetary radiation balance and thus may cause a
global temperature change. In addition, aerosols from soil dust,
biomass burning, and fossil fuel use are altering the amount and
geographic distribution of atmospheric aerosols, and thus
possibly affecting climate. The Global Aerosol Climatology
Project (GACP) is concerned with the climate forcing due to
changing aerosols, including both the direct radiative forcing
by the aerosols and the indirect radiative forcing caused by
effects of changing aerosols on cloud properties.

In Phase I of GACP, a 20-year global climatology will be
compiled of aerosol forcing data from satellite observations and
field observations for use in climate models. To accomplish
this, the Earth Science Enterprise (formerly called Mission to
Planet Earth) of NASA Headquarters, has issued a research
announcement (NRA-97-MTPE-16). Principal investigators of the
successful proposals will be included in the GACP Aerosol
Radiative Forcing Science Team. This team will provide
scientific guidance for a strategic approach toward definition
of radiative forcing, encourage appropriate collaboration among
research groups, and provide guidance to GACP. Phase II will
consist of complementary field studies.

The Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers -
Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE) is a measurement
campaign designed to investigate tropical cirrus cloud physical
properties and formation processes.  Understanding the production of
upper tropospheric cirrus clouds is essential for the successful
modeling of the Earth's climate

Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities warm
our climate. Two effects of this warming are the increase of clouds
and the rise of water vapor in the atmosphere. Both of these in turn
influence the impacts of the man-made gases on global warming. Clouds
can reflect the sun rays away from the surface, cooling the climate,
but they also act as radiative heat. These various interactions are
complex and not fully understood. However, the processes are crucial
in determining the eventual overall effect of manmade greenhouse gases
on the earth's climate. The detailed measurements from the
CRYSTAL-FACE mission will assist in improving our climate models. Six
aircraft will be equipped with state-of-the-art instruments to measure
characteristics of clouds and how clouds alter the atmosphere's
temperature. These measurements will be compared with ground based
radars, satellites, and the results of advanced atmospheric models, in
order to improve our ability to forecast future climate change. This
large multi-agency experiment will unite seven NASA centers, NOAA,
National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Office of Naval

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The main hypothesis of the ARGAU program is that the Southern Atlantic
Ocean would be the ocean reacting the faster and more intensely to the
climatic change induced by the anthropogenic atmospheric CO2
increase. To evidence these changes, ARGAU, a long term (10 years)
program based on oceanographic cruises (summer and winter, from Buenos
Aires to the Weddell Sea) onboard the Argentinean Icebreaker ?
Almirante Irizar ? is carried out. In order to describe, explain and
model the trend and variability of CO2 fluxes in this area at various
time scale, the physico-chemical characterization of the different
water masses is being studied together with the biological communities
present in the water column, within a multidisciplinary approach.

The first two cruises were carried out between 20 March and 14 May,
2000 (ARGAU Zero) and 2 January-15 April, 2001 (ARGAU 1). Different
frontal structures are revealed by sea surface temperature and sea
surface salinity gradients: The Patagonian frontal shelf, the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Malvinas cyclonic current. The
results of both cruises suggest that major part of the southwest
Atlantic Ocean appears as a CO2 sink. The strongest sink areas were
found around the Antarctic Peninsula (at 68?W) with a DPCO2 of
-80ppm. This strong sink is correlated to the highest fluorimetric
signal and chlorophyll-a concentration (around 4 mg.m-3) and
relatively low nitrate and phosphate concentrations (10 and 0.8 ?g.l-1
respectively). This could be explained by a bloom of Dactyliosolen
antarcticus (Castracane). The second strong sink observed at 56.5?W
with a DPCO2 of -40ppm is associated to the coldest temperature
(-1.8?C).

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Indian Ocean Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Regional consequences of global warming depend critically on the potentially large cooling effect of another pollutant, known as aerosols. These tiny particles, of about a millionth of a centimeter or smaller in diameter, scatter sunlight back to space and cause a regional cooling effect. These aerosols consisting of sulfates, soot, organic carbon and mineral dust are produced both naturally and by human activities. Results of numerous global warming models suggest that the aerosol cooling is one of the largest, if not the largest, sources of uncertainty in predicting future climate. Still, the complex influence of aerosol cooling on global warming is not clearly understood. This issue will remain a mystery unless field experiments, such as the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), are undertaken to collect in-situ data on the regional cooling effect of sulfate and other aerosols.

INDOEX addresses questions of climate change that are of high priority and of great value to the US and the international community. The project&amp;#039;s goal is to study natural and anthropogenic climate forcing by aerosols and feedbacks on regional and global climate. This issue is at the core of the International Global Change Research Program and has been identified by IPCC as a major gap in the science of climate change prediction. 

INDOEX field studies will occur where pristine air masses from the southern Indian Ocean including Antarctica and not-so-clean air from the Indian subcontinent meet over the tropical Indian Ocean to provide a unique natural laboratory for studying aerosols. Scientists will collect data from the water surface through the lower stratosphere, on the aerosol composition, reactive atmospheric gases, solar radiation fluxes, wind and water vapor distribution. To this end, investigators will use multiple aircraft, ships and island stations over the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Building on data collected in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, the intense field campaign will be undertaken during January to April, 1999. Field data will be used to calibrate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&amp;#039;s Earth Observing System instruments to obtain a regional map of the aerosol cooling effect. In conjunction with the regional scale satellite data, the field data will also be used to include aerosol effects in global warming prediction models.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Wildlife Health: Assessing the Cumulative Impacts of Multiple Stressors REVISION TO IPY FULL PROPOSAL #192</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Arctic wildlife species have evolved unique physiologies and have developed life-history strategies for survival in the harsh polar environment. However, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment Report indicates that the climate is rapidly changing in the Arctic and has the potential to alter wildlife habitat, facilitate the northward migration of wildlife diseases and parasites, and alter contaminant cycling. It is imperative that we understand and predict the cumulative impacts that will arise from the multiple stressors associated with climate change. Unfortunately, we have few analytical tools that can be used to assess changes in the health and condition of arctic wildlife. For instance, little is known about the effects on northern wildlife of pathogens or parasites arriving in the arctic from temperate regions; especially under conditions of chronic exposure to low concentrations of immunosuppressive contaminants, nor do we currently have the research tools to study these potential impacts. Our ability to interpret the significance of health indices in arctic wildlife is hampered by a general lack of knowledge concerning the range of normal disease prevalence and pathological conditions.
Wildlife populations are of great value to indigenous communities in the arctic as a source of country food and commercial harvests, as a draw for tourism, and as the cornerstone of cultural heritage and identity. Wildlife health assessment programs in the arctic can only be effective with the cooperation of communities that are in daily contact with wildlife and derive the benefits from utilization of this resource. There is a need to integrate traditional ecological knowledge with scientific research. Capacity building for research in communities in Canada’s north is not only mandated by the Territorial governments, but is necessary for the success of a long-term assessment program. Northern communities must be empowered to make decisions that are necessary to mitigate the socio-economic and cultural impacts of these changes.
We propose to develop a research programme that will:
i) Provide information on the health of arctic wildlife, using both scientific and traditional knowledge approaches.
ii) Develop techniques to assess and predict changes in the health and condition of arctic wildlife exposed to multiple stressors.
iii) Build capacity within arctic communities to participate in the assessment of wildlife health and respond to changes in wildlife populations.
iv) Train research personnel to participate in research on multiple stressors in the arctic using community-based approaches.
The research partners will bring a variety of research approaches, national and international contacts and matching funds to this IPY project. We will build upon existing collaborative relationships, institutional strengths and agency mandates. This project will take on a coordinating role to manage the collection of animals, distribution of tissues, pooling of data and communications among the various research groups, agency partners and communities. Included in this coordinating activity will be sharing of samples with partners involved in related IPY projects. In order to focus our efforts, we will concentrate our research on a relatively small number of wildlife species, including polar bears ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas). These species were selected for their position within the food chain, their importance as a food for indigenous peoples and relative ease of collection by hunters. The projects that will support this research goal are:
I) Evaluating the health and condition of polar bears:
There is a unique opportunity to build upon national and international collaborative linkages to describe the current health and condition of polar bears. The research team will use non-lethal sampling techniques to develop a profile of the health, condition, dietary status and contaminant burdens of polar bears, and identify biomarkers that are suitable for long-term assessment of the health of bears from several arctic and subarctic regions.
II) Evaluating the health and condition of ringed seals and beluga whales:
We will work in communities in the circumpolar region to evaluate the health and condition of ringed seals and beluga whales. This work will require the cooperation of hunters in the participating communities to obtain samples from animals and to provide traditional knowledge of any perceived changes in animal condition and health. Information will include morphometric data and gross observations of putative pathological conditions provided by the hunters, analysis of pathological conditions and parasite burdens in the skin, liver, GI tract, kidney and adrenal glands, and data on various biomarkers of stress.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The National Geoscience Data Repository System (NGDRS) was
initiated in response to the large quantities of at-risk
geoscience data held by the oil industry. Funded by the US
Department of Energy and the Petroleum Industry since 1995, the
American Geological Institute has been developing the NGDRS as a
system of geoscience data repositories, functioning as a
clearinghouse for data now becoming available to the public
domain, and for building coordination between existing data
repositories.

The system is envisioned as a fully distributed system of data
repositories joined together with the NGDRS metadata catalog,
GeoTrekTM. A wide range of political and economic circumstances
have been faced by the project, including full economic cycles
in the petroleum industry, changes in Federal administrations,
perceptions of funding competition, and poor relations between
industry and academia in the geoscience community, let alone
technology issues of managing distributed information systems.

xBy internally splitting the logical management of the project to
focus on data transfer/preservation issues, and metadata catalog
development and management, the NGDRS is positioning itself to
firmly establish a foothold in the community. By remaining
opportunistic on data transfers AGI has been able to extend the
volume of at-risk data transferred. Additionally, moving to
open-source and/or GPL'ed solutions for the Metadata Catalog,
AGI is focused on reducing the cost of entry and maximize the
level of control participating repositories have in the GeoTrek
system, all targeted at expanding the scope of holdings and
listings.

This Activity involves science and social science research that has been initiated as a result of the recent melting of glaciers and alpine ice patches. Melting of these scientific deep freezes, is providing unanticipated data sources that are giving us insight into past northern societies, flora/fauna, environments, and their changes through time. The field work is already happening as various independent projects in different northern North American jurisdictions (both Canada and United States), operating under northern leadership and direction. These projects will continue to operate in a similar manner if endorsed as an official IPY Activity. Thus the following Activity Summary refers to the work in general, rather than in project-specific terms.
In 1997/98, ancient organic artifacts and biological remains, particularly large quantities of caribou dung, were first found melting out of an alpine ice patch in southern Yukon, Canada (Kuyzk, et al., 1999, Arctic 52-2:214-219). The following year, 1999, the remains of Kwaday Dan Tsinchi meaning Long Ago Person Found in Southern Tutchone (Athapaskan) were found melting out of a glacier in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park in adjacent northwestern British Columbia, Canada (Beattie et al.,, 2000, Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24:129-147). 
In 1999, more artifacts and biological remains were found at other melting south Yukon ice patches. Within a few summer field seasons of research, significant specimens and samples (paleo-biological, or paleobiological and archaeological) were identified and/or collected from more than 70 mountain-top ice patches in the latter jurisdiction. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the frozen organic remains being recovered from the Yukon ice patch sites spanned the entire Holocene period (Farnell et al., 2004, Arctic 57-3:247-259. Hare et al., 2004, Arctic 57-3:260-272). 
The banking and curation of the samples/specimens recovered as a result of the Yukon ice patch work has been coordinated by the Yukon Government (Renewable Resources, and Heritage-Archaeology) with local study and analysis of materials, as well as research and identification work by collaborating scientists from other institutions. Studies related to the ancient artifacts have included feather identification and analysis by staff of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington (Dove, et al., 2005, Arctic 58-1:38-43), and paint analysis by staff of the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa (Helwig et al., unpublished). Studies related to the biological specimens have been wide-ranging, including: research on species, particularly caribou, genetic history through mtDNA research; caribou dietary analysis; industrial contaminants analysis; parasite history; pollen and vegetation history; ice patch shrinkage over time; etc. (Farnell et al., ibid.).
The Kwaday Dan Tsinchi project is also locally administered, with the concerned indigenous government, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, jointly managing the project with the province. The provincial museum (Royal British Columbia Museum), the Provincial Parks department, as well as scientists based in Canada, Germany, and Scotland are working with the community on the study and interpretation of this find, and the materials recovered there-from, with results now being published (e.g., Monsalve et al., 2002, American Journal of Physical Anthropology 119-3:288-291; Dickson et al., 2004, Holocene 14-4:481-486; Mudie et al., 2005, Canadian Journal of Botany 83:111-123; Richards et al., in press, American Antiquity). Both the discovery and the manner in which this unique find is being managed continue to receive international attention; the project is often pointed out as an example of how scientists and First Nations can work together on even the most sensitive of subject areas, human remains. 
Colleagues began fieldwork in adjacent Alaska in 2001, continuing in 2003, attempting to find glacier or ice patch archaeological sites in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. This work involved the development of a predictive model for identifying locations that should be targeted in the search for archaeological and/or biological specimens in these frozen landscapes (Dixon et al., 2005, American Antiquity 70-1:129-143). In 2003, state archaeologists successfully identified ice patch archaeological sites in the Tangle Lakes (Denali Highway) area of the state (Vanderhoek et al., in press, Alaska Journal of Anthropology). Fieldwork has continued in this location and elsewhere in the state, with ongoing analysis of the recovered materials.
The identification of ice patch sites yielding biological and cultural specimens and samples began in the Mackenzie Mountains region of Northwest Territories, Canada in 2005, with positive results (Andrews, 2005 communication to Activity leader). Plans are underway to search for ice patch sites in the Atlin area of northern British Columbia, Canada in 2006 (French, 2005 communication to Activity leader). Archaeological survey to search for specimens melting out of glaciers in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, U.S. is also to be initiated in 2006 (Howell, 2005 communication to Activity leader).
Fieldwork to find and recover the specimens and samples melting out of the glaciers and ice patches in northwestern North America, as well as to study the melting phenomena themselves, takes place during the height of the summer melt season each August. The fieldwork is generally conducted as day trips or short excursions, relying on helicopters for logistic support; over-view (fixed wing) flights have also been found to be useful. 
The materials being recovered from these frozen contexts include ancient artifacts, biological materials such as small bird and animal remains, dung from different species but predominantly caribou in the case of the ice patch sites, plant macro and micro remains, and ice block samples. The specimens collected are often fragile and following field documentation, in many cases must be quickly transferred to refrigerated storage to prevent deterioration. After recovery, the specimens and samples are curated in local government facilities whenever possible; professional Conservators are stabilizing the more fragile and significant artifact pieces. Laboratory work to study both the biological and archaeological specimens and samples recovered during these projects is being undertaking by government researchers based in the north, where-ever possible, working in collaboration with scientists/specialists at southern institutions. 
The local communities are involved, as well, in the study and interpretation of the recovered materials. For example, funds are being sought to document traditional indigenous knowledge related to the unique archaeological finds being collected by the Yukon Ice Patch project. Research to document the traditional aboriginal use of these landscapes is also part of the some of the projects. Museum displays on some of the finds are already in place, e.g., Kwaday Dan Tsinchi at the Royal British Columbia Museum, and more are in the works.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Biospheric Sciences Branch (formerly Earth Resources Branch)
within the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center and associated University investigators are involved in
a research program entitled Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) which is
fundamentally concerned with vegetation change of forest ecosystems at
local to regional spatial scales (100 to 10,000 meters) and temporal
scales ranging from monthly to decadal periods (10 to 100 years). The
nature and extent of the impacts of these changes, as well as the
feedbacks to global climate, may be addressed through modeling the
interactions of the vegetation, soil, and energy components of the
boreal ecosystem.

The FED ecosystem modeling research efforts concentrate on the North
American boreal and northern hardwood transition forests with
emphasis on optical and radar remote sensing technology. This
research employs an integrated approach of field and aircraft
studies, theoretical modeling, and satellite image data processing to
infer where landscape pattern and process ecosystem model predictions
succeed or fail at regional spatial scales and interannual temporal
scales. We are also using remote sensing observations as a check on
potentially observable forest ecosystem model predicted attributes
(e.g., species composition, tree height distributions, land use
patterns). Conversely, we are investigating the potential of remote
sensing observations for extracting biophysical properties of forest
canopies, soils, and hydrologic parameters used in our forest
ecosystem models. On-going work, in addition to activities discussed
here, include modeling, measurement, and data compilation or a number of
boreal zone sites.

The FED model framework (see Levine et al., 1983) integrates existing
models of forest growth and succession (i.e., FORET model of Shugart
and West, 1984 and ZELIG Model of Smith and Urban, 1988), soil
processes (Residue model of Bidlake et al., 1992; Bristow, et al.,
1986; TERRA model of Levine, 1984; Levine and Ciolkosz, 1988), and
energy dynamics (e.g., Smith et. al., 1981; Kimes and Kirchner,
1982). Each of the models interact with the others to provide feedback
controls on growth, soil related processes, and energy internal and
external to the forest environment. The forest succession and soil
process models require input at the species and soil characteristics
level, respectively. This makes this formulation useful for examining
the effects of changes in climate or anthropogenic factors on the
community composition and structure of the boreal forest.

The results anticipated from this experiment will enable development
and validation of the integrated model to usefully characterize the
ecosystem dynamics of the boreal forest under a variety of
conditions. A number of questions pertinent to the combined
experiment may then be considered. For example, how do climatic
gradients determine the spatial distribution of species within the
boreal forest? What are the possible effects of global climate change
on the boreal forest? Is the boreal forest a net source or sink of
carbon and methane and will the present state change if climate
changes? Also relevant to the issue of global change are the
magnitudes of the feedbacks between climate and vegetation. The
model, as formulated, can provide insights into the effects of
climate change on ecosystem dynamics, but does not consider the
effects of ecosystem changes on climate directly. However, the model
can provide, as outputs, factors that impact climate such as albedo,
evapotranspiration, and trace gas fluxes (i.e., carbon dioxide,
methane, and nitrogen). These questions are also relevant to the
BOREAS experiment.

The overall objective of our work was to capitalize on and develop the
unique advantages of remote sensing data combined with models of
forest ecosystem dynamics for characterizing northern/boreal forest
ecosystems, especially with regard to the interpretation of landscape
patterns and processes at local and regional scales.  Specific
objectives for the FED experiment at IP's Northern Experimental Forest
included:

1. Enhance the development of an integrated quantitative model which
   simulates forest, soil, and energy dynamics processes in northern
   forest environments. This will be achieved through modification and
   continuing development of the three types of sub-models discussed
   above.

2. Develop improved remote sensing technology to infer biophysical
   parameter inputs for forest succession and soil models. The
   relationships among remote sensing and forest canopy
   characteristics required by forest succession and soil process
   models will be developed and tested.

3. Develop a better understanding of the transfer and utilization of
   energy in forest canopies. This goal is being accomplished via
   collection of detailed spectral reflectance data in the field and
   laboratory, and by exercising existing radiative transfer models.

4. Use field and remote sensing observations to help infer where
   landscape pattern and process ecosystem models succeed or fail at
   local to regional spatial scales and interannual temporal
   scales. This objective is being accomplished through comparison of
   model predictions with field experimental data, and changes in
   successional stage, bioproductivity, and other biophysical
   parameters based on remotely sensed measurements.

5. Use field and remote sensing observations to help infer where
   landscape pattern and process ecosystem models succeed or fail at
   local to regional spatial scales and interannual temporal
   scales. This objective is being accomplished through comparison of
   model predictions with field experimental data, and changes in
   successional stage, bioproductivity, and other biophysical
   parameters based on remotely sensed measurements.

6. Use remote sensing observations as a check on such potentially
   observable forest ecosystem dynamic model predicted
   attributes. Specific ecosystem model algorithms and output
   parameters are being evaluated directly by examining relationships
   developed between sensor measured response and ecosystem
   attributes.

7. Use remote sensing observations and models to extract biophysical
   properties of forest canopies, soils, and hydrologic parameters
   used in our forest ecosystem models. Physically based radar and
   optical models are being applied to data collected over subsets of
   the Northern Experimental Forest to examine radar and optical
   scattering characteristics of different scene components. Model
   inversion strategies are also being applied for selected ecosystem
   model inputs.

The Coastal Observation Technology System (COTS) project grants were initiated
in 2002 to further the development of integrated coastal ocean observing
systems on a regional basis. The COTS projects are an alliance of
congressionally directed and competitively funded projects focusing on regional
coastal observation, research, technology and prediction, with an emphasis on
data management and integration. In FY05 13 projects were funded by
Congressional direction to contribute to the formation of IOOS. These projects
cover a wide range of ocean and coastal observations research activities,
including ecological forecasting, modeling, and storm surge prediction.

COTS funds also support competitively selected pilot observing system
technology projects (3) and regional coordination projects (11) to establish
the framework for Regional Associations (RAs). The RAs will serve as a forum to
improve the regional coastal ocean observing systems (RCOOS), by enabling
stakeholders to influence IOOS development by identifying and establishing
regional observation priorities.

These analyses are very inhomogeneous in time as there have been big improvements in the data assimilation systems. This played havoc with climate monitoring as these improvements were often produced changes in the apparent "climate". Even fundamental quantities such as the strength of the Hadley cell has changed over the years as a result of the changes in the data assimilation systems.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      
      Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura is a NASA mission to study the
      Earth's ozone, air quality and climate. This mission is designed
      exclusively to conduct research on the composition, chemistry and
      dynamics of the Earth's upper and lower atmosphere employing multiple
      instruments on a single satellite. EOS Aura is the third in a series
      of major Earth observing satellites to study the environment and
      climate change and is part of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise. The
      first and second missions, Terra and Aqua, are designed to study the
      land, oceans, and the Earth's radiation budget. Aura's chemistry
      measurements will also follow up on measurements which began with
      NASA'S Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite and continue the record of
      satellite ozone data collected from the TOMS missions.
      
      The EOS Aura satellite, instruments, launch, and science
      investigations are managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
      Greenbelt, Maryland. The satellite was launched in July 2004
      and will operated for five or more years. Scientific investigations will
      continue throughout the years the spacecraft is in operation and
      several years afterwards.
      
      The Aura Project staff includes managers, engineers, administrators
      and financial personnel, science advisory personnel, and functional
      Working Groups. The Project administers the contracts for each of
      Aura's instruments and the Aura spacecraft and specifies the launch
      vehicle. They oversee the design, fabrication, assembly and testing of
      each instrument and the integration of all the instruments to the
      spacecraft. They devise and implement the plans, specifications,
      schedules and budgets required to build the Aura spacecraft and deploy

http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=315

The existing general tectonic and structural maps of the Arctic and the Antarctic were published almost 30 years ago and featured mainly the Polar landmasses, whereas the offshore areas were left practically blank with only limited morphostructural information based on insufficient bathymetric knowledge. Since then, a vast amount of new data was accumulated in high latitudes, especially in their oceanic parts and continent-to-ocean transition zones where extensive geophysical and geological studies were accompanied by over-ice, submarine and ship-borne hydrographic surveys. On land the principal achievements were provided by modern isotope geochemistry methods that enabled better insight in crust-mantle relationships and improved dating of the earliest stages of geological history. As the result, a considerable progress in understanding the tectonic evolution of the Polar Regions was made, and at the same time new challenges for the future research came in sight. In particular, it became evident that conventional models of continent separation and sea floor spreading which could successfully be applied for Gondwana break-up and accompanying formation of the Southern Ocean were meeting serious difficulties in the North where their implementation appeared severely constrained by strong internal heterogeneity of the Arctic Ocean.
Portraying the antipodal structures of the Arctic and the Antarctic and analyzing the resemblances and dissimilarities in their tectonic frameworks and histories will not only have a fundamental importance for global geodynamics but also contribute significantly to climate change research through improving knowledge of evolution of the Polar oceans and formation of seaways. The educational value of the project will arise from presentation in a condensed form of a variety of earth science data ranging from sub-aerial, sub-ice and submarine topography to configuration of the base of the Earth's crust, and from genetic classification of the major structural assemblages and features to their spatial distribution and reflection in potential fields. The final maps will be presented at 1:10,000,000 scales (with supplementary smaller scale insets) in a circum-polar projection encompassing the area to 60o N/S.
The main objectives of the project include: (1) Integrating abundant Arctic and Antarctic geological data and tectonic interpretations disseminated in multinational literature into a coherent generalized legend that would allow the presentation of principal structural elements and historical particularities of both Polar Regions in a unified system of graphical designations and basic terms; (2) Compiling 1:10 M maps and smaller scale insets; (3) Preparing textual supplements to the cartographic products in the form of a short booklet and more extensive explanatory notes highlighting the tectonic essentialities of the Polar Regions in a comparative context; (4) Producing the first printed products by the time of 33rd Session of IGC (Oslo, 2008) and within the scope of IPY activities.
Achieving project goals will require participation of many countries, organizations and individuals. Adequate coordination and scientific guidance of project activities will be provided by CGMW.
The project is planned as a dedicated indoor effort not requiring special field expeditions and utilizing predominantly the already existing voluminous data. Additional new evidence relevant for the project purposes may, however, be readily assimilated from any 2006-2007 field activity executed by partner countries either on national basis, or within the IPY framework.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">THE WORLD BIODIVERSITY INFORMATION NETWORK</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Currently the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components is a priority, given the environmental crisis of the planet in recent decades. Knowledge of biodiversity becomes urgent in view of the rapid process of the loss of ecosystems, species and genes, as well as a broad spectrum of environmental services and products derived from plants and animals pending discovery or study.

In this sense, biological collections are one of the main sources of information on biological diversity. The large quantity of information they represent and the fact that they are dynamic require, for their consultation and updating, the use of specialized computer tools. Gathering these collections in an information network allows not only for the connection of the main databanks, the updating of information and direct contact with specialists, but also access, exchange and consultation of data open to the public in general throughout the world.

The World Biodiversity Information Network (REMIB) is a computerized system of biological information (it includes databases of a curatorial, taxonomic, ecological, cartographic, bibliographic, ethno-biological type, use of catalogues on natural resources and other subject matters), based on an academic inter-institutional decentralized and international organization, formed by research and higher education centers, both public and private, that possess both scientific biological collections and data banks.

PURPOSES

1)Promote the exchange of biotic information through an international network of databases, and to analyze and agree to joint policies on intellectual property, quality control and the forms for distributing the data. 
2)Increase and improve accessibility and quality of this information, maintaining it up to date. 
3)Offer basic knowledge of biodiversity to the public in general, under the rules and procedures established herein.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
      FIRE, the First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology
      Project) Regional Experiment, is going to the Arctic to study a
      variety of Arctic cloud systems under spring and summer
      conditions. A team of national and international scientists will
      conduct the FIRE Arctic Cloud Experiment (ACE) in a two-phase
      field campaign, starting in April, 1998, and a second phase to
      be conducted during July, 1998.

      The scientific objectives of FIRE.ACE will be to study impact of
      Arctic clouds on radiation exchange between surface, atmosphere,
      and space, and the influence of surface characteristics of sea
      ice, leads, and ice melt ponds on these clouds. FIRE.ACE will
      attempt to document, understand, and predict the Arctic
      cloud-radiation feedbacks, including changes in cloud fraction
      and vertical distribution, water vapor cloud content, cloud
      particle concentration and size, and cloud phase as atmospheric
      temperature and chemical composition change. FIRE.ACE will use
      the data to focus on improving current climate model simulations
      of the Arctic climate, especially with respect to clouds and
      their effects on the surface energy budget. In addition,
      FIRE.ACE will address a number of scientific questions dealing
      with radiation, cloud microphysics, and atmospheric chemistry.

      The strategy of FIRE.ACE is to use aircraft to take remote and
      in situ measurements of the Arctic cloud and surface
      characteristics. The NASA ER-2 will fly far aloft with a suite
      of remote sensors to remotely infer the cloud and radiative
      properties of the clouds that form in the vicinity of leads and
      melt ponds. The University of Washington Convair 580, National
      Center for Atmospheric Research C-130, and Canada National
      Research Council Convair 580 aircraft each will fly with a
      number of in-situ instruments to measure the optical, physical,
      radiative, and chemical properties of the clouds and radiation
      directly.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
 A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Program in Arctic Regional Climate Assessment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
PARCA is a NASA project formally initiated in 1995 by combining into
one coordinated program various investigations associated with
efforts, started in 1991, to assess whether airborne laser altimetry
could be applied to measure ice-sheet thickness changes. It has the
prime goal of measuring and understanding the mass balance of the
Greenland ice sheet. The main components of the program are:

      1. Periodic airborne laser-altimetry surveys along precise
      repeat tracks across all major ice drainage basins. The first
      survey was completed in 1993/1994, with repeat flights along
      selected routes in 1995 and 1996, when flights were also made
      over ice caps in eastern Canada, Svalbard, and Iceland.
      Ice-thickness measurements along the same flight lines Localized
      measurements of ice thickness change in shallow drill holes.
      Monitoring of various surface characteristics of the ice sheet
      using satellite radar altimetry, SAR, passive-microwave, AVHRR,
      and scatterometer data.  Surface-based measurements of ice
      motion at 30-km intervals approximately along the 2000-meter
      contour completely around the ice sheet, with interpolation of
      local relative ice motion using interferometric SAR.  Shallow
      ice cores (10 - 200 meters) at many locations to infer recent
      climate history, atmospheric chemistry, and interannual
      variability of snow-accumulation rates, and to measure
      temperature and vertical ice motion at various depths.

      2. Investigations of surface energy balance and factors
      affecting snow accumulation and surface ablation. This program
      is a collaborative effort with NSF, and includes the
      installation of automatic weather stations (AWS) at many of the
      drill-hole sites.

      3. Estimating snow-accumulation rates by climate-model analysis
      of column water vapor obtained from radiosondes and TOVS data.

      4. Detailed investigations of individual glaciers and ice
      streams responsible for much of the outflow from the ice sheet.

      5. Development of a thermal probe to measure various ice
      characteristics at selected depths in the ice sheet.
      6. Continuous monitoring of crustal motion using Global
      Positioning System (GPS) receivers at coastal sites.

 The objective of International GLOBEC's Small Pelagic fish And
 Climate Change program, (GLOBEC SPACC) is to identify linkages
 between the driving physical forces that control population
 growth of small pelagic fish populations. The long range goal
 is to forecast how changes in the pattern and intensity of
 these forces, caused by elevated greenhouse gases and global
 warming, will alter the productivity of small pelagic fish
 populations. Toward that end, fifty-four scientists met in La
 Paz, Mexico in June 1994 to begin developing a science plan for
 GLOBEC SPACC. Attendees represented interests in the fields of
 physical and biological oceanography, numerical modeling,
 zooplankton ecology, remote sensing technology, paleoecology,
 genetics, early life history of fishes, and population
 dynamics. The scientists recognized that the GLOBEC SPACC goal
 requires highly multi-disciplinary, cooperative research and
 approached this challenge with enthusiasm. They also recognized
 the need t!  o work together on shared stocks. They expressed
 their interest in developing regional (e.g. Humboldt Current,
 California Current, Patagonian Shelf, Baltic Sea, Mediterranean
 ) as well as national SPACC projects.

General: The aim of the proposed project is to study mechanisms, manifestations and impacts of bottom water formation on the bipolar Atlantic Ocean shelves. Key areas are the Barents Sea, and the southern Weddell Sea.

The proposed activity is to 
i) Identify key regions where dense water is formed and contributes to bottom water formation and thermohaline circulation; 
ii) Study cooling and freezing processes in these areas by remote sensing, in situ measurements and modeling;
iii) Estimate production rates of dense water; 
iv) Study cascading of dense water towards the deep ocean by direct measurements and modeling of the bottom plume characteristics like velocity and turbulent structures; 
v) Measure and calculate the mixing processes in these downward cascading waters and obtain production rates of bottom water; 
vi) Define physical and biogeochemical controls on ocean carbon biogeochemistry;

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Radio Ice Cerenkov Experiment (RICE) is an experiment designed to detect the Cherenkov emission in the radio regime of the electromagnetic spectrum from the interaction of high energy neutrinos (greater than 1 PeV) with the Antarctic ice cap. The goals of this experiment are to determine the potential of the radio-detection technique for measuring the high energy cosmic neutrino flux, determining the sources of this flux, and measuring neutrino-nucleon cross sections at energies above those accessible with existing accelerators. Such an experiment also has sensitivity to neutrinos from gamma ray bursts, as well as highly-ionizing charged particles (monopoles, e.g.) traversing the Antarctic icecap.

"Primary production in Antarctic coastal waters is highly seasonal,
yielding an intense pulse of biogenic particles to the continental
shelf floor. This seasonal pulse may have major ramifications for
carbon cycling, benthic ecology, and material burial on the west
Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) shelf. Thus, we propose a multi-disciplinary
program ot evaluate the seafloor accumulation, fate and benthic
community impacts of bloom material along a transect of three stations
crossing the Antarctic shelf in the Palmer LTER study area. Using a
seasonal series of five cruises to our transects, we will test the
following hypotheses:

1) A substantial proportion of spring/summer export production (circa
50%) is deposited on the WAP shelf as phytodetritus or fecal pellets.

2) The deposited bloom production is a source of labile POC (or a
'food bank') for benthos for an extended period of time (months)

3) Large amounts of labile bloom POC are rapidly subducted into the
sediment column by the deposit-feeding and caching activities of
benthos

4) Macrobenthic detritivores sustain a rapid increase in biomass and
abundance following the spring/summer POC pulse

To test these hypotheses we will use multiple-core and box-core
samples, radiochemical profiles, sediment respirometry, and time-lapse
bottom photography to evaluate (a) seabed deposition and lability of
POC, (b) patterns of POC mixing into sediments, (c) seasonal
variations in macrofaunal and megafaunal abundance, biomass and
reproductive condition, and (d) rates of POC and silica mineralization
and accumulation in the seabed. Fluxes of biogenic materials and
radionuclides into midwater particle traps (D.Karl, P.I.) will be
contasted with our seabed deposition and burial rates to establish
water-column and seabed preservation efficiencies for these
materials. Cruises (each 10-d in length) will be conducted to collect
these data in: November 1999 (shortly pre-bloom); Feb-Mar 2000 (at the
end of the POC pulse); Apr-May 2000 (near the end of the ice-free
summer period), Sept-Oct 2000 (near the end of the winter-ice period),
and Feb-Mar 2001 (end of second annual POC pulse). This project will
substantially improve our understanding of the spring/summer
production pulse on the WAP shelf, and its impacts on seafloor
communities and carbon cycling in Antarctic coastal ecosystems."

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The purpose of the GATE experiment was to understand the
tropical atmosphere and its role in the global circulation of
the atmosphere. It was the first major experiment of the Global
Atmospheric Research program, whose goal was to understand the
predictability of the atmosphere and extend the time range of
daily weather forecasts to over two weeks.

The experiment took place in the summer of 1974 in an
experimental area that covered the tropical Atlantic Ocean from
Africa to South America. The work was truly international in
scope, and involved 40 research ships, 12 research aircraft,
numerous buoys from 20 countries all equipped to obtain the
observations specified in the scientific plan. The operations
were directed by the International Project Office located in
Senegal. The Project Office staff was seconded by the nations
involved. The Scientific Director was from the United States and
the Deputy Scientific Director was from the Soviet Union.


An operational plan was developed each day based on the
meteorological situation and each ship and aircraft carried out
the plan. The data collected were processed by nations
participating in accordance with an overall plan and made
available without restrictions to all scientists in the
world. Research using these data still goes on today, nearly 25
years later, and it is estimated that over a thousand papers
have been published based on the data collected during this
short period in 1974.


The experiment involved the world's best scientists, all types
of engineers, technicians, pilots, ship captains, logistics
specialists, computer specialists, as well as senior policy
makers from science agencies and foreign ministries in a large
number of countries. A high percentage of the individuals
involved are still active and could contribute their views.

The Lidar-In-Space Technology Experiment(LITE) is being developed by
Nasa Langley Research Center for a series of flights on the
space shuttle. Using a laser,a telescope approximately 1 meter
in diameter and a modular design, the system will be used to
study clouds, trophospheric and stratospheric aerosols,
characteristics of the planetary boundary layer, stratospheric
density and temperature pertubations, and to some degree,
surface topography. The greatly improved resolution of LITE
with respect to passive sensors is expected to provide a new
and unique data set on the global distribution and optical
properties of clouds and aerosols , and therefore, their
radiative and chemical effects. In addition, this data set will
be useful in validating and improving retrieval algorithms
already in use. Similarly, the ability to accurately locate the
top of the planetary boundary layer will aid in global climate
model(GCM) parameterizations of flux transport between the
oceans and th!  e atmosphere. Measurements of density
pertubations in the middle stratosphere will provide a greatly
improved glimpse of the global dynamics of this region compared
to that given by current spaceborne sensors. The primary goals
of LITE are to demonstrate the maturity of space-based lidar
technology, to provide some unique measurements, and to provide
a platform for the development of technology for future
space-based systems.

several diseases on antarctic fauna is an important subject considered
by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.  There has been an
increase in the movement of people to and within Antarctica; tourist

travel quickly takes people, equipment and food to distant
localities. These factors directly contribute to an increase in the
risk of importing an exotic organism and or spreading of endemic

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=456

This proposal is being submitted to the IPY committee by northerners for the benefit of northerners. Being a resident of the arctic, I clearly understand the utter need for practical research that will help to strengthen and improve the health and well-being of community life, and will contribute to making our communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.

At the 2006 World Urban Forum it was acknowledged by global decision-makers that climate change will be one of the key challenges faced by human settlements across the world. The goal of this research node is to build capacity for sustainable community development in Arctic regions so they are less vulnerable, more liveable and stand a better chance of coping with challenges posed by climate change. In the Arctic, building this capacity requires a proactive approach, collaboration amongst a wide range of partners, integration of policies across scales (national, regional, local), accommodation of cultural priorities, and practical application of research. 

This is reflected in the 2005 Research Needs Survey for Nunavut published by C-CIARN North. It states:
The survey results suggest that Nunavut community members recognize considerable overlap among climate change impacts and that they do not generally view climate change adaptation challenges in isolation of other social and environmental pressures. Local climate change pressures need to reflect this holistic perspective, and focus largely on understanding the interactions and cumulative effects of climate change and a host of other factors such as resource development, rapid social change, population growth, health decline, educational achievement, long range contaminant transport, and other factors.

Clearly there is a growing need for the practical application of research on the uncertainty, challenges, and impacts of climate change on Arctic communities. However, in the Arctic there is a large gap between scientific research and building capacity for sustainable development.

This research will contribute practical results to climate change impact and adaptation research, provide examples of mitigation and contribute to the improving the health and well-being of Arctic communities. Areas of focus will be on housing design, building technology, alternative energy, community planning, waste management and capacity building. The current housing situation in many Arctic communities is one of severe overcrowding and complete reliance on diesel fuel for energy needs. This situation is leading to negative mental and physical health problems to individuals and leaving communities vulnerable to rising fuel prices. 

Research under this activity cluster will take a much needed holistic approach to creating more environmentally friendly, affordable and culturally responsible housing options that positively contribute to the health and well-being of northern-based communities. Increased Arctic planning capacity will be needed in order to maintain community resiliency. This will require the integration of traditional knowledge and scientific research and involve Inuit, First Nation/Aboriginal groups, northerners, community planners, and scientists in different regions of the Arctic.

Collaboration will involve Arctic and national governments, northern and southern-based organizations, and Arctic communities.

The main objectives of Project OCOMA are: 
-Development and installation of a new instrument, developed by INTA to observe Bro and OClO total columns.
-To widen the scarce available information about the time-space distribution of stratospheric NO2, O3, OClO and BrO  in Antarctic and Subantarctic regions
-To set latitudinal, seasonal and interannual trends in NO2 behaviour as well as to understand its effect on stratospheric O3
Daily twilight observations of NO2 and O3 total columns were made over Belgrano, Marambio and Ushuaia during the term of the project. These measurements were performed with the EVA DOAS-Spectrometers, which have been developed by INTA and were brought to the three sites by means of a co-operation agreement between INTA and DNA (Argentina), within the framework of a wider project  for continuous monitoring of the Antarctic and subantarctic stratosphere.  
35-40 ozonesondes were launched every year allowing the measurement of ozone vertical profiles over Belgrano.
OClO and BrO total columns over Belgrano were obtained through the  setting up of the spectrograph NEVA, a new instrument using  the DOAS technique. 
Another instrument, TEI-49C, came also into operation leading to observations of surface ozone levels in Belgrano.

Los objetivos fundamentales del proyecto OCOMA han sido:
-Desarrollo e instalacion de un nuevo instrumento desarrollado por el INTA para la observacion de la columna total de  BrO y OClO.
-Incrementar la escasa informacion existente sobre la distribucion espacio-tiempo del NO2, Ozono, OClO, BrO presentes en la estratosfera en las regiones antartica y subantartica. 
-Determinar las tendencias latitudinales, estacionales e interanuales de NO2 e interpretar su influencia sobre el O3 estratosferico
Durante el periodo de desarrollo del proyecto se realizaron observaciones crepusculares diarias de la columna total de NO2 y ozono sobre Belgrano, Marambio y Ushuaia utilizando los espectrometros DOAS (EVA). Estos instrumentos, desarrollados por el INTA fueron instalados en estas estaciones en 1994 gracias a un convenio de colaboración entre la Direccion Nacional del Antartico (Argentina) y el INTA. Estas observaciones estan enmarcadas en un proyecto mas amplio de monitorización continuada de la estratosfera antartica y subantartica   
Se adquirieron perfiles verticales de ozono sobre Belgrano utilizando sondas electroquimicas(ozonosondas), lanzandose 35-40 sondas al año.
la instalacion del nuevo instrumento permitio obtener las columnas totales de OClO y BrO sobre Belgrano con el espectrografo NEVA  utilizando la tecnica DOAS
La instalacion del instrumento TEI-49 C permitio la obtencion del ozono superficial en la estación Belgrano

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Polar Exchange at the Sea Surface (POLES) is an EOS
interdisciplinary project investigating the exchange of mass and
energy at the air-ice-ocean interface in the polar regions.  POLES is
a broad investigation into the role of polar regions in the global
energy and water cycles, and the atmospheric, oceanic and sea ice
processes that determine that role. The primary importance of
investigation is to show how these polar processes relate to global
climate.  The POLES program is located at the Polar Science Center,
Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington. The primary goal
of the Earth Observing System (EOS), a program of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is to advance the
scientific understanding of the entire Earth system.

Scientists from 8 disciplines and 4 institutions have joined together
in the POLES investigation to use the rich array of satellite data
collected from the polar regions. The data have been collected using a
variety of satellite-based sensors, including passive microwave
radiometers, the TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), Advanced
Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR). POLES scientists use satellite data to build an understanding
of long-term patterns in the fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum
across the surface of the polar oceans. Their goal is to assimilate
satellite (and some buoy) observations into polar ocean-atmosphere
models that not only refine the treatment of surface exchange
processes, but also quantify the roles of horizontal transports,
oceanic mixing, and deep convection. With better use of data,
researchers can move beyond present climatological descriptions and
document interannual variability.

The SEPA project was a deployment of broadband PASSCAL instruments in
Chilean Patagonia, the South Shetland Islands, and the Antarctic
Peninsula. The initial ten broadband seismographs were deployed during
January and February, 1997. Additional sites were added in 1998 and
1999. A complementary 6 month deployment of ocean bottom seismographs
in the Bransfield Strait and South Shetland Islands (BSOBS) took place
in early 1999. Most of the seismometers were removed in December 1999,
but one Patagonia station and three Antarctic stations continued to
operate until November 2001. The purpose of SEPA is to study the
tectonics and structure of the region.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">"http://www.tor.ec.gc.ca/CRYSYS/"

CRYSYS is Canada's contribution to NASA's Earth Observing System
(EOS) Program.  Its mission is to develop capabilities to monitor and
better understand variations in major components of the cryosphere
(sea ice, lake ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps and frozen
ground/permafrost).

CRYSYS was initiated by Canadian scientists in 1988 in response to
NASA's request for research related to its Earth Observing System
Program ( EOS).  CRYSYS offers Canadian scientists opportunities to
play a significant role in developing methods for extracting
information on the cryosphere from conventional and remote sensing
systems as part of EOS.  CRYSYS also provides Canadian scientiests
with a link to the data and information system of EOS (EOSDIS),
 and allows CRYSYS investigators access to the huge volumes of
satellite data being archived under the EOS program.  In 1993, the
Meteorological Service of Canada, Environment Canada, took over the
role of principal sponsoring agency for CRYSYS.  CRYSYS currently
involves over 30 researchers from 14 universities and 4 federal
agencies.

The basic scientific goals of CRYSYS are:

- to develop capabilities for monitoring and understanding regional and North
American variations in cryospheric variables;
- to develop and validate local, regional and global models of climate/
cryospheric processes and dynamics to improve understanding of the role of the
cryosphere in the climate system;
- to assemble, maintain and analyze key historical, operational and research
cryospheric data sets to support climate monitoring and model validation.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The purpose of the Oregon Transect Ecosystem Research (OTTER) Project was to estimate major fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and water in forest ecosystems using an ecosystem-process model driven by remotely sensed data. The project was conducted from 1990 to 1991. The DAAC's data holdings include background data from 1989. 

The goals of OTTER were

1. to simulate and predict ecosystem processes, such as photosynthesis, transpiration, aboveground production, nitrogen transformation, respiration, decomposition, and hydrologic processes;

2. to combine field, laboratory, and remote-sensing techniques to estimate key vegetation and environmental parameters;

3. to construct a geo-referenced database for extrapolating and testing principles, techniques, and prediction; and

4. to verify the predictions through direct measurements of process rates or controls on processes. 

OTTER's main objective was to estimate major fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and water in forest ecosystems through the use of an ecosystem-process model driven by remotely sensed data. Other objectives included the following: to simulate a forest ecosystem and predict a variety of parameters through the use of a computer model; to characterize the spectral variability in conifer foliage between age classes, species, and sites; and to characterize the stand mean and variability in the Leaf Area Index.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The NASA Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) is a NASA
sponsored project to develop scatterometer-based data time series to
support climate studies of the Earth's cryosphere and
biosphere. Originally developed to measure winds over the ocean from
space, scatterometer data has proved to be very useful in a variety of
studies including polar ice and tropical vegetation. Because the
scatterometer radar signal can penetrate the surface, a scatterometer
can observe subsurface/subcanopy climate-related features.

The launch of Seasat, carrying a Ku-band scatterometer (SASS), in 1978
provided a baseline against which studies of global change can be
measured. Other missions have followed SASS, including the C-band
European Space Agency (ESA) Earth Remote Sensing (ERS) -1 and -2
missions (1992+), the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) mission in 1996-97,
SeaWinds on QuikSCAT (1999+), and SeaWinds on ADEOS-II (2002). With
their rapid global coverage, day or night and all-weather operation,
scatterometers offer a unique tool for long-term climate studies. The
goal of the SCP is to provide scatterometer-based datasets to
researchers involved in climate studies.

The SCP datasets are based on a time series of enhanced resolution
images made from the scatterometer backscatter (sigma0) measurements
using the Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) and SIR w/filtering
algorithms. For the highest possible spatial resolution (as well as to
ensure full coverage over the images) multiple orbit passes are
combined. For SASS, NSCAT, and ERS, images of sigma0 at 40 deg
incidence angle (A) in dB and the slope of sigma0 versus incidence
angle (B) in dB/deg are made. For SeaWinds on sigma0 images at the
observation incidence angle are made. In addition to these images, a
number of ancillary images and products are generated include sea ice
extent maps and sea ice motion data sets.

HyCODE field experiments are located 1) off the coast of New Jersey at the Long-term Ecological Observatory site in 15 m water depth (LEO-15), 2) on the west Florida Shelf as part of the ONR Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms ( EcoHAB) program, and 3) in the Bahamas near Lee Stocking Island as part of the ONR Coastal Benthic Optical Processes (CoBOP) program. This website focuses on the New Jersey shelf, which is located in the New York Bight (NYB) and the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). The main objective of the HyCODE program is to develop an understanding of the diverse processes that control inherent and apparent optical properties (IOPs and AOPs, respectively) in the coastal ocean by use of hyperspectral imagery. Basic research is centered on the investigation of the impact of relatively small-scale physical, biological, and chemical processes on near-surface spectral IOPs and AOPs. Some of the processes under investigation for the HyCODE project include advection of optically important material, phytoplankton growth and loss, bubble injection, sediment resuspension, fronts, and internal waves. Applied research focuses on the development and validation of hyperspectral ocean color algorithms.

The IPY Publications Database will identify and index the publications that result from the International Polar Year 2007-2008. This activity is a crucial part of IPY data management. Providing searchable metadata for IPY publications is as important as providing searchable metadata for IPY datasets. The IPY Publications Database is essential for the identification, dissemination and preservation of the achievements of the IPY. Twenty years from now, when someone asks, "What did the IPY accomplish?".  The IPY Publications Database will provide a major part of the answer. As described in later sections of this proposal, the IPY Publications Database will also make a significant contribution to achieving the legacy, education, outreach and communication targets of the IPY.

The IPY Publications Database will be created by an expansion of the existing polar bibliographic infrastructure. The Cold Regions Bibliography Project (CRBP) at the American Geological Institute currently produces the Bibliography on Cold Regions Science and Technology and the Antarctic Bibliography. The Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) Library at the University of Cambridge produces the SPRILIB database and assists the CRBP with the Antarctic Bibliography. The Arctic Science and Technology Information System (ASTIS) at the Arctic Institute of North America, University of Calgary, produces the ASTIS database. All of these databases, and others, are combined by National Information Services Corporation (NISC) to produce the Arctic &amp; Antarctic Regions (AAR) database describing more than one million polar publications.

The IPY Publications Database will be created by dividing responsibility for the coverage of IPY publications between the CRBP, the SPRI Library and ASTIS; by using the IPY Data Policy to ensure that all IPY publications are reported to at least one of these organizations; by obtaining funding that allows these organizations to index the increased number of polar publications that will result from the IPY; and by having NISC include the resulting bibliographic records in both the AAR database and a new free IPY Publications Database. Bibliographic records (metadata) for IPY publications will include citations, detailed subject and geographic indexing terms, and, in most cases, abstracts. Most IPY publications will be available online, and the records describing IPY publications will contain DOIs or URLs linking to the full-text of the publications.

With the IPY Joint Committee support for this proposal, the members of the consortium are confident that they can obtain the necessary funding for this activity. At the peak of IPY indexing, which will occur two to four years after the IPY observation years, the amount of new money required may be about 10% of the consortium members' normal budgets. Raising this amount of additional money should be quite feasible. In the unlikely event that sufficient new money cannot be obtained, the members of the consortium will index as many IPY publications as possible themselves, and will encourage other members of the Polar Libraries Colloquy (the international organization of polar libraries and databases) to help fill any gaps.

Providing access to the publications that result from the IPY is just as important as providing access to other types of IPY data. The IPY Publications Database will ensure that IPY publications are identified and made accessible.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Transantarctic Mountain Aerogeophysical Research Activities</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) rift-flank uplift has developed along the ancestral margin of the East Antarctic craton, and forms the boundary between the craton and the thinned lithosphere of the West Antarctic rift system. Geodynamic processes associated with the exceptionally large-magnitude uplift of the mountain belt remain poorly constrained, but may involve interaction of rift-related mechanical and thermal processes and the inherited mechanical elements of the cratonic lithosphere. The Transantarctic Mountain Aerogeophysical Research Activities (TAMARA) program proposes to document the regional structural architecture of a key segment of the Transantarctic Mountains in the region around the Royal Society Range (Fig. 1) where the rift flank is offset along a transverse accommodation zone. In December through January, 1998, the TAMARA group flew a helicopter aeromagnetic survey and collected ground gravity station data. These data will be integrated with other geologic and geophysical information from the region in order to map the large-scale structures along the TAM where relations between longitudinal and transverse structures along the rift flank can be resolved. 

During the 1997-1998 field season, the TAMARA project collected about 14,100 line-km of helicopter magnetic data, covering an area just a little less than 30,000 km2 (Fig. 2).  One hundred twenty-five hours of helicopter time were used to complete the survey. Relative to the initial plans, 92.5% of line-kilometers, or 95% of the planned area, was covered. 

Magnetic base stations established in McMurdo and the Skelton Neve field camp recorded the daily variations of Earth&amp;#039;s magnetic field for removal from the total-field observed from the helicopter. The position of a cesium magnetometer carried in a bird slung 30 m below the helicopter was accomplished with Trimble 4000 GPS receivers. Barometric altitudes were also recorded. The data from each flight were quality controlled. 

The crew for the aeromagnetic helicopter-borne program consisted of 3 helicopter support personnel (including 2 pilots and an engineer) and 6 scientific staff (geophysicists, engineers, and quality control specialists). Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (BGR) contributed a geophysicist, an engineer, and a quality control specialist. Three additional scientists were from the USGS and Ohio State University. A general assistant for camp operations and a mountaineer were supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). 

In addition to the aeromagnetic data, 65 gravity stations were collected in profile-form in the Skelton Neve region.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=408

The aim of this project is to establish mobile field-stations as an innovative research instrument for long-term comparison of human-Rangifer interactions in the subarctic zone. The primary focus of observation is the human-Rangifer link under current impact of socio-economic and climate change. Establishing a mobile observation facility (nomadic camp) offers the best possibilities for long-term observation in the natural environment of the tundra. Thus, researchers use the same practice of following herds that most Rangifer users themselves have used for centuries. The trajectory of the mobile station is determined by the annual migration of a chosen Rangifer herd. The data is recorded in a standardized form, dealing with impact/response description related to socio-economic and climate change, respectively. This data is transmitted from the field on a web-site of the project at regular sessions. After completion of the first migration in the centre of the Kola Peninsula (NW Russia), the station shall be made available to other researchers of the human-Rangifer link. Every effort shall be made to continue the work of the station on a longitudinal basis, inviting the cooperation of interested sub-arctic oriented institutions.
Follow-up activities envisage a potential network of monitoring stations in the Eurasian sub-arctic zone. Such a network shall be able to transmit data, including visual material, on a regular basis through the Internet. A synchronized pan-subarctic monitoring network shall be potentially able to provide a global information exchange on current change/ resilience situations, related to the Human-Rangifer complex.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=170

The impact of non-native (alien) species on ecosystems is one of the big issues of the 21st Century. Human travel is occurring at an unprecedented level across the globe.

Currently alien microbes, fungi, plants and animals occur on some parts of the Antarctic continent and most of the sub-Antarctic islands. These have been transported to the region through human activity (Frenot et al 2005). Introduction routes are largely associated with movement of people and cargo in association with national scientific program and tourist operations (Whinam et al 2005). The impact of these alien species ranges from minor transient introduction to substantial loss of local biodiversity and changes to ecosystem processes and evolution. With rapid climate change occurring in some parts of Antarctica, greater numbers of alien introductions and more successful invasions by aliens are likely, with consequent increases in impacts on ecosystems (Bergstrom and Chown, 1999).

This project aims to assess the extent to which the annual migratory human population carry propagules (seeds, spores, eggs) of alien species unintendedly into the Antarctic region. It aims to take a snap shot of the propagule load during the first IPY summer. This project will be the first time that an assessment of the extent of transfer of alien species into an entire biome has ever been made. 

This project will attempt to assess the propagule load carried by people on a large subsample of Antarctic voyages/flights into the Antarctic and subantarctic islands during the 2007/08 summer of IPY. Expeditioners' outer clothing and equipment will be inspected for propagules. Samples will be collected and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and using scaling- up procedures total propagule loads will be assessed. Furthermore recent travel histories of expeditioners will be taken, to assess potential sources of propagules. The significance of this element of the project is that propagules from cold areas such as the Arctic will have a greater chance of establishing in the Antarctic than those from warmer ecosystems.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Arctic ecosystems are being strongly affected by global change and there is strong interest in being able to predict ecosystem responses to disturbance and for developing viable strategies for conserving biodiversity and managing the consequences of climate changes. Several international initiatives have been implemented to monitor and study the response to global warming of some tundra ecosystem components such as plants or permafrost. However, similar internationally-coordinated efforts for research on arctic food webs focusing on wildlife species (i.e. birds and mammals) are lacking. Yet, arctic food webs throughout the circumpolar world generally contain few species and are often dominated by the same groups of species, and so lend themselves well as systems suitable for comparative research. Our project will focus on key species of herbivores (e.g. geese, lemmings, and muskox), insectivores (e.g. shorebirds), and predators (e.g. foxes, snowy owls, falcons, gulls, and jaegers), and their interactions at a large number of arctic sites across North America and Eurasia. There will be a special effort in providing data from the winter period, which is poorly described in the Arctic. A primary objective is to document patterns of abundance, distribution, and phenology of reproduction of these species over large spatial and temporal scales using standardized protocols. These patterns will be related to local and regional climatic conditions. A secondary objective is to determine the relative importance of bottom-up (resources) and top-down (predators) forces in structuring these arctic food webs, and how climate affects these trophic linkages. Lemmings, which form the backbone of the terrestrial food web of the arctic, fluctuate cyclically in many locations, reaching peaks every 3-4 years. These cycles are reflected in cyclic abundance of specialist predators such as arctic foxes, snowy owls, jaegers, and weasels, which in turn may affect production of alternative prey like geese and shorebirds. Some of these complex interactions have been studied locally (Gauthier et al. 2004), but there have been few quantitative regional surveys to investigate synchrony among independent populations. In particular, we do not know how much synchrony occurs between or within continents, and this will affect how predators can operate within these polar ecosystems (Krebs et al. 2002). Geese and shorebirds are migratory birds using the Arctic only for summer breeding and offer an interesting contrast. Many goose populations have increased worldwide in recent decades, and goose grazing now has a large impact on several arctic wetlands. Although their population increase is largely fuelled by events occurring on their wintering grounds, they impose a large allochthonous influence on the tundra that seriously impacts ecosystem functioning (Abrahams et al. 2005, Gauthier et al. 2005). In contrast, many shorebird species appear to be declining worldwide, largely for unknown reasons (International Wader Study Group 2003). Shorebirds are a vital component of Arctic biodiversity with 37 species present in various parts of the circumpolar Arctic, but their globe-spanning migrations put their populations more at risk than most other species. Indeed, as global change will occur at varying speed and intensity at different latitudes, they will face multiple threats throughout their annual range, posing unique challenges for conservation. Arctic foxes are key predators of the arctic tundra that feed mostly on lemmings and birds. Their habitats have been recently invaded by red foxes in many parts of Eurasia and North America. Global warming should exacerbate this pattern but consequences on the arctic food chain are currently unknown. Foxes constitute a prime example of the changes in community structure that probably awaits the arctic tundra. Our project will build on arctic sites that already have a history of monitoring the wildlife species described in this proposal (core sites). Other sites will be added for the duration of IPY to expand the spatial coverage to poorly-known areas of the tundra (secondary sites). Inclusion of sites that lack some significant components of the arctic biota (e.g. islands without lemmings, geese or weasels) should allow fruitful comparisons to understand the role of these species in the arctic ecosystem. The abundance and distribution of all relevant species will be determined annually using the same technique at all sites. For birds, this will be largely determined by finding the nests of breeding individuals, which will also provide information on phenology. Similarly, for foxes this will be based on finding and monitoring active dens. For lemmings, various trapping techniques (snap and live-trapping) will be used. We will take blood, hair or feather samples from vertebrates (especially nomadic predators) for genetic and isotopic analysis to better understand population differentiation and trophic linkages. Exclosures will be built to monitor resource availability for herbivores, and their grazing impact. Insects will also be sampled to determine their seasonal abundance for insectivorous birds. Radio-tracking of some species will be used to monitor patterns of habitat use and activity. Winter work of resident arctic species will rely on direct observations or remote techniques (e.g. satellite or GPS radio-tracking). Climatic data will also be recorded at most sites year-round using automated stations. Our leading principle will be to collect data and to conduct experiments using a set of standard protocols that will allow comparison across all sites, and eventually meta-analyses of data from several sites.Abrahams, KF et al. 2005.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">International Partnerships in Ice Core Science</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Ice cores provide information about past climate and environmental conditions on timescales from decades to hundreds of millennia, and direct records of the composition of the atmosphere. As such, they are cornerstones of global change research. For example, ice cores play a central role in showing how closely climate and greenhouse gas concentrations were linked in the past, and in demonstrating that very abrupt climate switches can occur.

With the completion of major projects in Greenland and Antarctica over the last 15 years, the international ice coring community is planning for the next several decades. The costs and scope of future work create the need for coordinated international collaboration. Developing this international collaboration is the charge of IPICS, the International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences, a planning group currently composed of ice core scientists, engineers, and drillers from 18 nations. IPICS is supported by PAGES (Past Global Changes), SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) and IACS (International Association of Cryospheric Sciences), although it is not a formal project under any of these organizations.

Two international meetings in 2004 and 2005 (Brook, E. and Wolff, E.W., The future of ice core science, EOS, 87 (4), p. 39. 2006) lead to an ambitious four-element framework that both extends the ice core record in time and enhances spatial resolution. The scientific goals and their implementation have been outlined in the four IPICS White Papers - available from the IPICS website.

Short Title: IPICS
Project URL: http://www.pages-igbp.org/ipics/Proposal URL:http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=117

IPICS-related events planned for IPY include:

1. Searching for the longest possible ice core record. The oldest Antarctic ice core so far extends 800-900 kyr. Before this, Earth's climate had a 40 kyr glacial-interglacial periodicity. IPICS aims to find a 1.2 Myr record and help discover why the period changed. During IPY, initial survey work will occur as part of the TASTE-IDEA ice divides traverses, by French/Italian/Russian teams in the Dome C-North Vostok-Dome B region, by a Chinese team near Dome A, and by US-led radar and remote sensing teams. IPICS will collate results to recommend drilling sites.

2. Initiation of coring to recover the last interglacial and older ice from Greenland. The last interglacial was probably warmer than the present and is an analogue for an anthropogenically-warmed world. We need to learn about the behaviour of climate and the Greenland ice sheet during times of warmer climate. The oldest reliable core only partly penetrates the last interglacial. Drilling in northwest Greenland would start, and possibly finish, in IPY. Danish, US, French, Japanese, UK, Swiss, Swedish, and German groups have expressed interest, and others are expected to join. Note that while this effort is part of the IPICS agenda, it also falls under IPY lead project # 561 (Greenland's Ice Sheet - reactions to past and present climate change), which will lead IPY efforts related to this element of IPICS. 

3. Starting a detailed spatial network of deep and intermediate-depth Antarctic ice cores. The spatial pattern of change is key to climate dynamics. We have cores from central East Antarctica and from a few coastal regions, but additional data are needed from other key areas, including the northern part of Lake Vostok, coastal Antarctica, the Antarctic peninsula, and West Antarctica. New projects like the European drilling at Talos Dome (east Antarctica) will take place during IPY. These programs will provide a springboard for a larger effort to fully sample Antarctic spatial climate variability on all possible time scales. 

5. The WAIS Divide Ice Core. This West Antarctic ice core will produce the best climate record covering the past 100,000 years, including highly resolved histories of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and millennial and shorter time-scale climate change in Antarctica. The main drilling starts during IPY, in the 2007/2008 Antarctic field season.

4. Late Holocene climate change. Future change can only be assessed in the context of natural climate variability. Highly resolved compilations of past global climate (timescale up to 2000 years) critically lack polar data. The SCAR project, ITASE, produced 250 cores that cover the last 250 years. Extending this time scale to the last millennium, and expanding the scope in the Arctic, are critical. IPY will engage all countries to complete work in Antarctica and continue the effort in the Arctic.

6. SOFIA (Search for the Oldest Firn Interstitial Air). SOFIA aims to obtain firn air records spanning more than the last 150 years, encompassing much of the period from the industrial revolution to the present day. Large firn air samples are critical for understanding this period of atmospheric history as they allow measurements (of trace species or isotopic ratios) that are otherwise impossible with ice core samples.

The scientific objectives of ANtarctic benthic DEEP-sea biodiversity: colonisation history and recent community patterns - SYSTem COupling (ANDEEP - SYSTCO) are: 
-to build on the international and interdisciplinary investigations which were begun during ANDEEP I-III. 
-to add a novel, innovative aspect to polar biological research - and to ANDEEP - by involving scientists from different disciplines, such as atmospheric sciences, climatology, hydrography, planktology, physical oceanography, geophysics, geology, sedimentology, bathymetry etc. to shed light on atmospheric-pelagic-benthic coupling processes.
-to broaden the scientific scope of ANDEEP, by the use of innovative technology (modern satellites, very fine-meshed plankton samplers, novel sea-bed landers, ROVs, plankton suctors, etc., to train a new generation of polar scientists.

Important issues addressed are: 

Atmosphere: measurements of parameters like aerosols, ozone, reflectivity, UV irradiance, or volcanic activity (SO2) via spacecrafts (e.g. Adeos, Nimbus, OMI) will for example inform about the particle load of the atmosphere, and the magnitude of light penetration (e g. Cryosat for surface fluxes and vertical profiles of the fluxes in the atmospheric boundary layer). 

Plankton: influence of atmospheric processes on processes in the water column, of the biogeochemistry of the surface water on primary productivity, the importance (e.g. biomass and diversity) of the nanoplankton in the food web, vertical changes in the plankton community to abyssal depths. 

Benthos: biology of abyssal key species. Role of the bottom-nepheloid for recruitment (larvae) of benthic animals (plankton suctor). Influence of quantity and quality of food sinking through the water column for abyssal life. Functional morphology &amp; physiology of abyssal animals.

Seabed characteristics: Effects of sedimentology, biogeochemistry, and pore water on benthic life in time and space (palaeontology). Sedimentation rates and processes over time (geophysics, sub-bottom 3.5 kHZ profiler; detailed bathymetric mapping).

ANDEEP-SYSTCO is a multi-national IPY project that contributes to EBA and CAML.

Recent changes in surface elevation and discharge speed in outlet glacier systems along the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet have provided examples of dramatic localized shifts in the balance of ice discharge, surface melt, and accumulation. These rapid changes are in sharp contrast to relatively slow variations in surface elevation in the interior, which have been tied to accumulation and firn compaction variations on a decadal timescale. The challenge of documenting and attempting to understand the processes involved has motivated a large collection of proposed research projects aimed at this problem. These range from expansions of ongoing efforts to new projects, and from individual investigators to consortia from a number of nations. They utilize a range of observational and modeling techniques and exploit evolving capabilities in atmospheric modeling, remote sensing for measurement of ice motion and surface conditions, and surface-based and aircraft-based measurement techniques. 

To maximize the efficacy of efforts, an effective and timely dialog between these diverse projects is required. This dialog must encompass discussion of planned research, including field campaigns and modeling studies, interactions among field parties where practical, and rigorous discussion of results. To communicate effectively our emerging understanding, it would be of great benefit to maintain a current discussion of the collective state of the research in a common location. We believe that this new concentration of efforts focused on the downstream end of the mass balance problem in Greenland by investigators from many nations meshes well with the goals of the IPY, and forms a natural core IPY activity in Greenland.

Work associated with this cluster is diverse, but the value of coordination at the international level is clear. Examples of activities that will benefit include: fieldwork that involves at least two projects from different nations using lidar and satellite measurements to track surface height change; numerous field and remote-sensing based studies of ice flow variations and patterns of surface melting; at least two projects that will use atmospheric models to estimate surface energy and mass balance; and a number of studies will exploit different approaches to ice flow modelling to interpret observations. A common goal in these studies is the documentation and understanding of ice sheet marginal change in Greenland.

This proposal for a core activity for the IPY is aimed at facilitation of communication and collaboration among an open group of consortium members, with the goal of enhancing coordination of field measurement campaigns, modeling studies, and remote sensing measurements dedicated to understanding surface conditions and ice discharge in Greenland. The intent is to use the umbrella of the IPY to lower barriers to international interaction and cooperation between projects at all scales. The improved connectivity is intended to begin at the start of projects, to have an impact on planning and measurement strategies, and continue through data analysis and into special sessions at international meetings and include integrative topical meetings specific to Greenland. 

In this cluster proposal we identify a number of projects that have just received notification of funding for research that will continue through the IPY time period, projects that have submitted full proposals for funding to national funding agencies, and projects that are still in their formative stages. The suite of projects included here provides the beginning of a roster that can grow through the IPY period. All consortium members will adhere to National and ICSU requirements for IPY data policies, and utilize available resources for outreach coordination. Most activities directly involve students, and will be actively involved in training the next generation of polar scientists.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
In order to better understand the tropical ocean/atmosphere system and
its effect on the climate at higher latitudes, the Tropical Ocean and
Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program was initiated in 1985 by the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO), with contributions from nations
including the USA, UK, USSR, Japan, Australia, India and Chile.  TOGA
was a major component of the WMO's World Climate Research Program
(WCRP) and was effective in bringing together the international
scientific research community to work on problems of global
significance.  Scientific oversight was provided by the TOGA
Scientific Steering Group who reports to the Joint Scientific
Committee of WCRP.  International coordination was organized through
the International TOGA Project Office in Geneva and the 18-member
Intergovernmental TOGA Board.

The U.S.  contribution to TOGA involved the National Oceanic
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Science Foundation (NSF),
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  NOAA
involvement includes the Climate Analysis Center (CAC), NOAA
Environmental Research Laboratories (Pacific Marine Environmental
Laboratory (PMEL), Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological
Laboratory (AOML), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), and
the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL), and the
National Oceanographic Service (NOS).  NSF support was funded
through its Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Divisions and through NCAR.
NASA's effort was funded to NASA centers and academic principal
investigators while the Office of Naval Research (ONR) supports a
number of university scientists.

TOGA is a 10-year international program that began January 1, 1985 and
continued through 1994.

The major elements of the TOGA Praogram Plan are modeling, empirical
studies, process studies and long-term observations.  Three types of
models are being used: (1) oceanographic models, in which the wind
stress and heat flux at the air-sea interface are prescribed and the
time-dependent response of the upper layers of the tropical ocean is
simulated; (2) atmospheric models, in which the global circulation is
simulated given various prescriptions of the tropical SST field; and
(3) coupled atmosphere-ocean models, which are integrated forward in
time from a prescribed set of initial conditions.  Empirical studies
are focusing on interannual and intraseasonal variability along with
statistical analyses of lead-lag relationships that may have relevance
to seasonal climate prediction.  Long-term observations include
interfacial measurements, and atmospheric and oceanographic
observations.

Science Objective:
-To gain a description of the tropical oceans and the global atmosphere as a
 time-dependent system, in order to determine the extent to which this system
 is predictable on time scales of months to years, and to understand the
 mechanisms and processes underlying that predictability.
-To study the feasibility of modeling the coupled ocean-atmosphere system for
 the purpose of predicting its variations on time scales of months to years.
-To provide the scientific background for designing an observing and data
 transmission system for operational prediction if this capability is
 demonstrated by coupled ocean-atmosphere models.


Data Used and Produced:
Long-term monitoring is among the more focused of the program elements
of TOGA.  It is a prerequisite for numerical simulation and long-term
prediction of the coupled climate system, and it supports process and
empirical studies.  Interfacial measurements such as wind stress, sea
surface temperature (SST) and surface energy fluxes are most central
to the ocean-atmosphere coupling and are attaining the highest
priority.  The major sources of surface wind data over the tropical
oceans are moored buoys, ships of opportunity and island stations.
The moored buoys transmit wind, air temperature, SST and subsurface
temperature via the ARGOS/TIROS-N system.  Wind observations from
ships and island stations are transmitted via the Global
Telecommunication System (GTS).  The CAC has been producing monthly
mean SST analyses with about 2 degree spatial resolution, based upon a
blend of in situ (ship and buoy) data and Advanced Very High
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data, while also monitoring
net energy flux monthly mean fields generated by one of the
operational numerical weather prediction models at the National
Meteorological Center (NMC).

Observations of the global atmosphere in suapport of TOGA relied
heavily on the World Weather Watch/Global Telecommunications System
(WWW/GTS).  The observing network consists of two polar-orbiting
satellites and the full array of geostationary satellites, ships of
opportunity, buoys, and surface and upper-air stations.  The Global
Precipitation Center at CAC has been supportive in producing
preliminary estimates of tropical convective precipitation from
1986-1988 based on satellite imagery from the U.S., Japan and the
European Space Agency (ESA) geostationary satellites.  Ships of
opportunity and approximately 50 drifting buoys are being used to
measure sea level pressure, air temperature and SST over data-sparse
regions of the equatorial and extratropical South Pacific.  The
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and ERL have
contributed some upper-air systems and Doppler profilers to the
surface and upper-air network.

The ocean observing system consisted of tidal gauges, satellite data,
moored (ATLAS) and drifting (Langrangian) buoys and and ships of
opportunity.  The island tide gauge network along with altimetric
range data obtained from military satellites provided sea level data.
Expendable Bathythermograph System (XBT) lines from ships provided
soundings to analyze the thermal structure and the heat content. Ships
also carried out conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) surveys in
the upper 1000m of the ocean.  Moored buoys, instrumented with current
meters and thermistor chains also provided subsurface thermal
structure and current data.  Circulation was measured utilizing
equatorial moorings and from a field of over 130 mixed-layer
Langrangian drifters.

Our activities span the development and delivery of software tools for analysis and visualization, the provisioning of advancing visualization and collaboration environments, web engineering for all of UCAR, R&amp;D endeavors in collaboratories, the development of a new generation of data management and access, Grid R&amp;D, novel visualization capabilities, and a sizable outreach effort.

VETS grew to 22 staff members in FY2003, which includes several student contributors and new positions coming from external funds. We were awarded continued NCAR funding for a Cyberinfrastructure Strategic Initiative, and this covers two additional staff positions. We were successful in our bid to the NSF ITR Program and received an award to join with U.C. Davis in developing new visualization technology. We also received a three-year grant from NASA to develop a Grid environment for biogeochemical modeling and analysis, an effort that will have substantial synergy with our Community Data Portal (CDP) and Earth System Grid (ESG) projects. We complete another year as a strong contributor to the Unidata-led THREDDS effort. VETS contributed as an unfunded partner to the NSF Alliance Expedition, Scientific Workspaces of the Future, which is moving forward the tool agenda in the context of the Access Grid. We submitted a proposal to join NSF's Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF) and were competitive, but did not receive an award.

Our NCAR Command Language (NCL) software continues to grow in popularity in atmospheric science research, but it is also being adopted by other agencies, the military, the Earth Simulator Center in Japan, and even in classrooms. We added some important new capabilities this year, in particular the ability to effectively visualize data with curvilinear coordinate systems, which is important for CCSM and other research efforts. This year we launched an aggressive effort to refactor our core software structure in support of developing a new language layer, Python, on top of NCL's formidable capabilities. This is an important first step toward a larger, next-generation framework. We also deployed SGI's Visual Area Networking as a pilot project aimed at evaluating one approach to delivering powerful 3D visualization onto a wide variety of user desktops.

It provides end-to-end capabilities for managing NASA’s Earth science data from various sources – satellites, aircraft, field measurements, and various other programs. For the EOS satellite missions, EOSDIS provides capabilities for command and control, scheduling, data capture and initial (Level 0) processing.  These capabilities, constituting the EOSDIS Mission Operations, are managed by the Earth Science Mission Operations (ESMO) Project. NASA network capabilities transport the data to the science operations facilities.

The remaining capabilities of EOSDIS constitute the EOSDIS Science Operations, which are managed by the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project. These capabilities include: generation of higher level (Level 1-4) science data products for EOS missions; archiving and distribution of data products from EOS and other satellite missions, as well as aircraft and field measurement campaigns. The EOSDIS science operations are performed within a distributed system of many interconnected nodes (Science Investigator-led Processing Systems and distributed, discipline-specific, Earth science data centers) with specific responsibilities for production, archiving, and distribution of Earth science data products.  The distributed data centers serve a large and diverse user community (as indicated by EOSDIS performance metrics) by providing capabilities to search and access science data products and specialized services.

TerraSAR-X (TSX), the first German long-duration radar mission, is being realized in the frame of a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Astrium GmbH. The spacecraft will carry as primary instrument an X-band imaging system and a high-performance antenna system, enabling different operational modes. The spacecraft will be injected into a sun-synchronous, circular dusk-dawn orbit at approximately 514 km altitude. The launch is foreseen for mid 2005 from the cosmodrome Baikonur. The mission is designed for a five year lifetime. The satellite payload will generate and down-link X-band SAR raw data, which will be processed on ground to generate X-band SAR basic products. Both partners will use SAR data and basic products for their respective fields of interest, DLR for standard science applications, Astrium for the commercial market. TSX SAR data for the science community will be made available by the DLR CAF in Oberpfaffenhofen. GFZ Potsdam and the CSR in Austin are collaborating in providing a precise dual frequency GPS flight receiver to the mission to enhance the quality of the scientific SAR products. GFZ Potsdam, the CSR in Austin and the Technical University Berlin are in particular interested and will collaborate in the precision processing of TerraSAR-X SAR data for environmental, geophysical and hydrological investigations.  In view of the extensive scientific interest in the multi-mode X-Band SAR data from the TerraSAR-X mission and in view of the great importance the accurate orbit ephemeris information has for all application modes, it is proposed that GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) in collaboration with the University of Texas Center for Space Research (CSR) provides a Tracking, Occultation and Ranging (TOR) instrument package, consisting of an experimental IGOR-class high-quality GPS tracking receiver and a CHAMP-class laser retroreflector set, and the necessary support for the integration of the instrument package aboard the TSX spacecraft, GFZ and CSR jointly verify the in-orbit performance of the flight receiver and laser retroreflector data and compute high-precision TSX orbits from the validated TOR package data in order to enhance the efficiency of the SAR data processing and the quality of the SAR data products, GFZ and CSR both collect atmospheric and ionospheric radio occultation (RO) data with the same IGOR receiver for augmenting the global RO data sets as obtained from other LEO satellites (CHAMP and GRACE) to be used for improvements of numerical weather forecasts, climate change studies and space weather monitoring. Derived fundamental atmospheric and ionospheric quantities (e.g. temperature, water vapor) will be used as complementary information for SAR error correction. GFZ, CSR and the Technical University Berlin (TUB) Institute for Photogrammetry and Cartography use the resulting high quality orbit and atmospheric correction products in conjunction with DLR-provided TSX-X band SAR data for the regions specified in B.1.2.3 for improved scientific analyses. As mentioned before, the primary scientific applications are monitoring the evolution of city surface subsidence, to monitor and model local geologic hazards such as landslides and rock falls and to assess the impact of ice sheet and glacier system dynamics.

Global atmospheric and oceanic pathways and processes result in the deposition of semi-volatile organic contaminants in the Arctic. With the ratification of the Stockholm POPs protocol the Arctic has become a strategic location with which to monitor global contaminants. Polar bears are top arctic predators, and hunted regularly by indigenous people, which so far has not been a threat to the stability of circumpolar subpopulation numbers. Polar bears are also captured and released for various research and monitoring porojects and thus accessible for biosampling. Polar bears are therefore ideal biomonitors of spatial and temporal distribution, dynamics, fate, biomagnification and potential effects of legacy and emerging organic contaminants of anthropogenic origin and present in the arctic environment. Furthermore, polar bears are indicators of ecosystem health and environmental change such as in sea ice habitat due to global warming. POPs and mercury and their concentrations in polar bear fat have been corelated to a number of biomarker endpoints of various effects including bone density, histology of immunological organs, renal lesions, liver morphology, immune function and/or hormones in polar bears from Svalbard, East Greenland and the Canadian Arctic.

Polar bears are exposed to a wide range of organohalogen contaminants at relatively high concentrations because of their high trophic level dependence as well as their preference to the blubber of their prey. For example, POP studies carried out in the circumpolar Arctic have shown high levels of selected POPs in polar bears from especially East Greenland, Svalbard and Russian Arctic. The highest levels POPs such as oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor and p,p-DDE were found in bears from Franz Josef Land and Kara Sea in the Russian Arctic. Polar bears from the Western Russian Arctic are exposed to higher levels of chlordanes and p,p-DDE than polar bears from locations westwards and eastwards from this region. Bears from the Western Russian Arctic (Franz Josef Land and Kara Sea) also had highest PCB levels compared to Svalbard, East Siberian and Chukchi Sea. A number of POPs such as PBDE, PFOS and chlorinated compounds are expected to increase to high levels.

By 2007-2008 it will be almost a decade since the last semi-circumpolar assessment of the spatial and temporal distribution of legacy and emerging POPs, and their metabolic by-products, was conducted in polar bears. Furthermore, the last truly circumpolar assessment, including bears from the Russian Arctic, will have been at least 15 years past. Emerging contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other brominated flame retardant compounds and perfluorinated compounds, have also yet to be determined in polar bears from the Russian Arctic. In addition, two related IPY pre-proposals are also being submitted, with essentially the same international, collaborative team, to assess the circumpolar, spatial and temporal distribution of legacy and emerging contaminants - including the rising mercury levels in the Western Arctic - in polar bear and ringed seal (blubber), which is the major dietary species for polar bears. 

Therefore, we propose to examine region-specific effect parameters (histology on internal organs, bone morphology) from necropsy samples taken via local Inuit hunters and haematology samples from the on-going telemetry studies, clitoris biopsies and rectal, vaginal and tracheal swabs and blood samples for bacteriology/virology, cytology and parasitology, vitamin and hormone profiles. These will be linked to the potential relationship between regionally bioaccumulation differences for the organohalogen contaminants and mercury levels. Fatty acid profiles and stable isotopes will also be determined to assess region-specific similarities and differences in polar bear diets linked to habitat climate factors - such as ice extent - from climate changes. Futhermore, genetical analysis would be helpful in the differentiaton of subpopulations in relation to hunting and management. This will be facilitated through the IUCN PBSG (Polar Bear Specialist Group) lead by Denmark as given in the resolutions from the last meeting in Seattle, June 2005. Beside this, a large Danish-Greenland research programme with numeours international scientific cooperation partners has been on-going since 1999, with several international published peer-reviewed papers. 

The present study would follow up previous work by resampling the same polar bear subpopulations with the help of polar bear biologists and hunters in circumpolar countries, with extension to populations in the Russian Arctic. This proposed project will build on the network of interested scientists in Alaska (USA), Nunavut/Canada, Greenland/Denmark and Norway, as well as new Russian collaborators, that was established in 2000-2001. The proposed study would complement polar bear and ringed seal programs envisaged under IPY, or ongoing in each country, which are focussed, broadly speaking, on marine mammal ecology including polar bears. It would also link to human health and social integrity studies related to traditional diet and contaminants as well as climate changes. The project would use a common protocol for sample collection (timing, tissue type, preservation) and analysis. Chemical analysis would be done in 3-4 Canadian, Danish and Alascian labs (few specialised analyses might be done by a single specialized lab) while the pathological/micro pathogen analyses may be done at different national labs. Tissues would be archived for future chemical analyses. The contaminant results would be interpreted in terms of temporal trends (compared to previous studies on the same populations), spatial trends (especially of new contaminants) and potential for effects on polar bears and by extension to human exposure. In addition markers of climate changes will be developed, analysed and interpreted.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Pan-Arctic Lake Ice Cover Under Contemporary and Future Climate Conditions</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Lake-ice cover has been shown to be a robust indicator of climate variability and change. Recent studies have demonstrated that break-up dates, in particular, have been occurring earlier in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere over the last 50 years in response to warmer climatic conditions in the winter and spring seasons. Break-up dates, and to a lesser extent freeze-up dates, have been shown to be strongly related to the variability and trends in the 0oC isotherm dates as well as large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns (teleconnections), particularly in western North America. The impacts of recently documented trends in air temperature and winter precipitation over the last five decades and those projected by global climate models could be significant on the timing and duration of ice cover (and on ice thickness) on Arctic lakes. This could, in turn, have an important feedback effect on energy, water, and biogeochemical cycling in various regions of the Arctic. How ice phenology (i.e. freeze-up/break-up dates, ice cover duration) and ice thickness have changed over the last five decades, and what will likely be the impacts of projected 21st century climate warming on ice cover for lakes of various depths in different regions of the pan-Artic domain are questions that must be examined in order to gain a deeper understanding of climate-lake interactions in the Arctic. The proposed research project will seek to answer these pressing questions. The overall goal will be to provide a pan-Arctic view of the temporal and spatial variability and trends in lake ice cover in relation to teleconnection patterns during the second half of the 20th century, and plausible scenarios of the response of lake ice cover to projected future climate.

The analyses from this research will provide a better understanding of the impacts of the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations on past lake-ice conditions. This, along with modelled projections of future climate, will offer insight into future regional changes to lake-ice characteristics and resultant hydrologic and ecologic impacts over various regions of the Arctic. The goal of the proposed project reflects very well the goals and objectives of the US-lead initiative Study on Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) in detecting and elucidating the recent changes in the Arctic and their impacts on human lives and activities. It is also directly related to the overarching goal of the pan-Arctic Community-wide Hydrological Analysis and Monitoring Program (Arctic-CHAMP) which seeks to better understand and predict the arctic hydrologic cycle. More specifically, the proposed research will provide observations and modeling results which will help fill current gaps in understanding the pan-Arctic hydrological cycle. This project is of direct relevance to three of the five main scientific themes of IPY: 1) to determine the present environmental status of polar regions by quantifying their spatial and temporal variability; 2) to quantify, and understand, past and present environmental and human change in polar regions in order to improve predictions; and 3) to advance our understanding of polar – global teleconnections on all scales, and of the processes controlling these interactions. Results of this project will contribute valuable information to other IPY projects, most notably “The State and Fate of the Cryosphere”, as well as international climate change programs (e.g. Climate and Cryosphere (CliC), Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), Integrated Global Observing System (IGOS) – Cryosphere) and assessments such as the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Ultimately, this project will not only deliver a pan-Arctic view of the response of lake ice to past and future climate conditions, but will also highlight the impacts of ice cover changes on regional climate, hydrology, lake ecology, and Arctic communities.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Superfund Locations and Populations</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The contamination of groundwater and soils with arsenic (As) and manganese (Mn) is associated with major public health, remedial, and environmental policy problems. Both arsenic and manganese are found at numerous Superfund sites. This Superfund Research Program (SRP) seeks to obtain new knowledge, facilitate the translation of these findings into policy applications, and train multidisciplinary pre- and post-doctoral students concerning the health effects, geochemistry, and remediation of As and Mn, with a particular focus on groundwater. The program has involved substantial work at the single most seriously As-affected Superfund site in Vineland, New Jersey. It also encompasses epidemiologic studies of As- and Mn-exposed adults and children residing in Bangladesh, New Hampshire and Maine. As in the past, the Columbia University SRP includes a unique balance of highly integrated  biomedical and non-biomedical research.

As indicated in the list on below, the program includes three biomedical research projects, intimately intertwined with three non-biomedical projects; these projects are supported by research support cores. An Administrative Core is responsible for the supervision, coordination, and financial accountability of the entire SRP. The Research Translation Core "Collaborating with Government &amp; the Public: As &amp; Mn Exposure via Groundwater" provides additional mechanisms for sustained communications among the SRP research projects, cores, government agencies, and interested parties. The RTC also helps government agencies and the public evaluate and address local groundwater contamination by providing geospatial data integration, mapping, and field assistance. Finally, the newly created SRP Community Engagement Core aims to reduce health risks of residents in Maine who rely on domestic wells for water supply and who are exposed to arsenic, and other contaminants including radon (Rn), uranium (U) and manganese (Mn).

Abstract:
The Bransfield, Prince Gustav, and Larsen Rifts form a unique triple
volcanic rift system that straddles the northern tip of the antarctic
Peninsula parallel to the South Shetland Trench and Island Arc. The
Bransfield Rift has created the Bransfield Strait back-arc basin that
separates the South Shetland Island Arc from the northwest tip of the
Antarctic Peninsula. This project includes a detailed geochemical and
petrological study of the volcanism produced in the earliest stages of
the rifting of an arc and the creation of a back-arc basin. All three
of the rifts in this system have produced Late Tertiary-Recent alkali
basalts that provide a unique opportunity to sample the chemistry of a
subduction contaminated mantle wedge. By analyzing the geochemistry,
petrology and isotopic signature of the recent, simultaneous
volcanisms in these three rifts. This project will be able to
constrain the chemical and spatial extent of chemical contamination of
a mantle wedge by a subducting lithospheric slab.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Race, Income and Environmental Hazards</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Project Overview:

The preponderance of empirical evidence, thus far,
suggest that racial minorities (Blacks, Hispanics,
Latinos, etc.) and low-income groups are subjected
to disproportionately large amounts of pollution and
environmental risks in their neighborhoods. Minorities
and the poor are known to be adversely affected by
unregulated growth, ineffective regulation of industrial
and hazardous waste facilities, and local land use policies
that favor those communities with political and economic
clout (Bullard, 1994a). Environmental justice, defined as
the provision of fair, equitable treatment of people of all
races, cultures and income with respect to the development,
implementation and enforcement of laws, regulations and
policies, has become an issue of top priority in the United
States. However, despite the strong regional and national
interest in environmental justice, our ability to determine
the disproportionate distribution of environmental risks
within minority and low-income populations is still lacking.
In general terms, it is well understood that racial minorities
and the poor shoulder a disproportionate share of environmental
hazards, but the computer-based tools needed to effectively
redress existing and future environmental justice concerns
are yet to be developed, especially for Iowa. In order to
achieve a full understanding of the process and casual
mechanisms of involved in environmental justice, an
integrated and spatially explicit modeling approach is needed.

Project Goal:

The work proposed here will develop a GIS-based tool
and prototype system that will allow us to investigate
issues of environmental justice involving hazardous waste
facilities, underground storage tanks, and large hog farms
in Iowa. The study will integrate a wide range of existing
environmental, socioeconomic, and demographic databases with
ArcView GIS and S-Plus statistical analysis software to test
the overarching hypothesis that higher levels of environmental
degradation in Iowa are associated with race, ethnicity and
income. A detailed geographic analysis will be conducted to
weigh the relative strength of the association of race and
income with the distribution of environmental hazards
identified above. The target audiences for the study are
environmental citizen groups, state resource agencies,
racial minority groups, and federal government agencies
charged with environmental and public health mission.

This study will address three environmental statutes:
the Safe Drinking Water Act, through analysis of large
hog farms and waste lagoons; Toxic Substances Control
Act, through analysis of hazardous waste facilities in
the EPA?s Toxic Release Inventory; and the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(through analysis of underground storage tanks).
Furthermore, since the study will use a GIS-based
approach to enhance understanding of environmental
inequity problems and will involve workshops and
information exchange, it meets the first and third
program goals identified in the Office of Environmental
Justice Small Grant Program.

This study has the potential to make significant
fundamental contributions to our understanding of
environmental justice concerns in Iowa and to provide
the basis for targeting and/or prioritizing enforcement,
pollution prevention, education, and outreach programs
required in the implementation of environmental justice.
Also the project will provide the tool needed by resource
agencies to develop comprehensive regional and statewide
strategy for responding to environmental justice concerns.

After 233 orbits (16 days), it is back at its starting point and the pattern repeats. Thus, every 16 days, Aura re-examines the same portions of the atmosphere, and its instruments are able to measure changes that may have occurred in each sampled area. The satellite and its instruments are scheduled to perform their atmospheric studies for five years.

The world oceans are a major component of the Earth System and changes in the complex global ocean current system are likely to cause global environmental changes. On geological time-scales, these water mass exchanges are controlled by the deepening and shallowing of areas of ocean floor during the tectonic opening and closing of strategic oceanic gateways and the formation of ocean basins. Establishing the detailed tectonic, geodynamic, sedimentary and paleo-topographic histories of strategic oceanic basins and gateways will provide the essential framework for modelling studies that will relate these events to paleo-climate observations collected across the globe.
                 
PLATES &amp; GATES adopts a multidisciplinary approach by addressing tectono-magmatic, geodynamic, sedimentary and biostratigraphic processes, utilising paleo-biological and geochemical proxies, past and recent oceanographic conditions in the gateways, as well as by using state-of-the-art geophysical techniques, sediment coring, ocean drilling and accompanying land investigations.

The main objectives include:
(1) studies of the crust/lithosphere of the polar ocean basins and polar gateways as well as their continental margins to develop a good understanding of the past and present plate kinematics, mantle processes, margin formations, and crustal subsidence and uplift processes, 
(2) understanding the past ocean current systems in the basins and gateways by examining the record of change preserved in deep-ocean sediment deposits and drifts, and by undertaking seismic-stratigraphic investigations and analyses of present and paleo-oceanographic proxies to derive the evolution of deep-water circulation and climate change, 
(3) reconstructing detailed ocean basin and gateway opening processes and constraining the timing of shallow and deep water mass exchange between basins, 
(4) understanding the long-term paleo-climatic history from Mesozoic-Early Tertiary Greenhouse conditions to upper Tertiary-Quaternary Icehouse conditions, and 
(5) identifying and modelling the role of gateway openings/closures in the global carbon cycle, bio-evolution and the development of ice-sheets and climatic changes. 

Paleomagnetic, stratigraphic and petrological data from Franz Josef Land, Axel Heiberg I., Ellesmere I., the New Siberian Is. and North Greenland will be collected and analysed. Geoscientific studies including bathymetric mapping, seismic and magnetic surveying, sub-bottom profiling and sediment coring will be carried out in the Amundsen Basin, on transects across the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge, over the Lomonosov Ridge and from the North Greenland Shelf. Geological and neotectonic studies are planned for North and East Greenland, Svalbard, Bear Island, Mohns Ridge, Knipovich Ridge and the Barents Sea. The gateways between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean will be investigated by a wide spectrum of geophysical and geological approaches to understand the timing and paleo-climatic consequences of water mass exchange. The Bering Strait, as the only freshwater connection between the Arctic and the Pacific, will be investigated by geophysical surveying and geological sampling (drilling). Geophysical and bathymetric surveying as well as geological and biological sampling is planned for critical regions of the Southern Ocean that formed since the break-up of Gondwana. A thorough revision of this break-up will be performed in parallel with new data acquisition giving special emphasis to the compilation and integration of existing data sets. Uncertainties about the early stages of development of the Drake Passage/Scotia Sea gateway will be resolved by studies of the tectonic and sedimentary evolution of the basins and the origin of bathymetric highs, the structure and history of relevant plate boundaries, and deformation of neighbouring land areas. Geophysical data will be collected in the Tasmanian Gateway to constrain the timing of shallow and deep-water opening between the Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as the motion between East and West Antarctica which is critical to the timing of the uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains. Other regions of interest include the passage between the southern Kerguelen Plateau and Antarctic continent as well as major topographically outstanding transform and fracture zone systems in the Pacific. 

PLATES &amp; GATES will perform Cenozoic and Mesozoic climate reconstructions using a variety of Earth system models designed to evaluate the effect of ocean gateways and basins on paleo-circulation patterns, the global carbon cycle and nature of polar ice-sheet development. These experiments will include sensitivity runs incorporating new paleo-bathymetric reconstructions arising from the new data acquisition described above. The results from these experiments will be compared with other model simulations, which include different forcing factors such as atmospheric greenhouse gasses and mountain uplift to determine the relative importance of paleo-geography on the evolution of polar and global climates over long geological timescales.

the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) of the World
Climate Research program (WCRP). It was established by the WCRP in
1986 with the initial goal of providing monthly mean precipitation
data on a 2.5 x 2.5 degree latitude -longitude grid for the period
1986-1995. This was recently extended to the year 2000. The GPCP will
accomplish this by merging infrared and microwave satellite estimates
of precipitation with rain gauge data from more than 30,000
stations. Infrared precipitation estimates are obtained from GOES
(United States), GMS (Japan) and Meteosat (European Community)
geostationary satellites and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) operational polar orbiting satellites. Microwave
estimates are obtained from the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program (DMSP) satellites using the Special Sensor Microwave Imager
(SSM/I). These data sets will be used to validate general circulation
and climate models, study the global hydrological cycle and diagnose
the variability of the global climate system. Data are available
beginning in January 1986. Merged satellite and gauge data are
available starting with July 1987.

The GPCP is developing new products. One product that is under
development is a one degree global daily product. Another set of
products under development include SSM/I derived rain variability
parameters (rainfall, variance, aerial coverage, etc).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
 Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is an energy technology that
 converts solar radiation to electric power. OTEC systems use the
 ocean's natural thermal gradient?the fact that the ocean's
 layers of water have different temperatures?to drive a
 power-producing cycle. As long as the temperature between the
 warm surface water and the cold deep water differs by about 20?C
 (36?F), an OTEC system can produce a significant amount of
 power. The oceans are thus a vast renewable resource, with the
 potential to help us produce billions of watts of electric
 power. This potential is estimated to be about 1013 watts of
 baseload power generation, according to some experts. The cold,
 deep seawater used in the OTEC process is also rich in
 nutrients, and it can be used to culture both marine organisms
 and plant life near the shore or on land.  The economics of
 energy production today have delayed the financing of a
 permanent, continuously operating OTEC plant. However, OTEC is
 very promising as an alternative energy resource for tropical
 island communities that rely heavily on imported fuel. OTEC
 plants in these markets could provide islanders with much-needed
 power, as well as desalinated water and a variety of mariculture
 products.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=313

The Dome A region is the highest plateau of the Antarctic ice sheet, and could be the coldest place on the Earths surface. The transect from Prydz Bay-Amery Ice Shelf-Lambert Glacier Basin-Dome A is an interconnected ocean, ice-shelf and ice sheet system, which plays a very important role in east Antarctica mass balance, sea level and climate change. Dome A is a little known region of the Antarctic and, as it is the highest part of Antarctic ice sheet, it is an ideal place for observing the earths environmental background and making new scientific findings in a range of disciplines
 The ice thickness at the summit of Dome A was measured as over 3000 m by the 21st Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition (CHINARE-21) in the austral summer of 2004/2005. Snow accumulation occurs mostly by diamond dust sublimation directly from the troposphere and the oldest ice in Antarctica may be found there. It is hence a potential site to reconstruct a 1.2M year recordof the past climate and environment.
 With the extremely cold, dry and stable air found at the summit of Dome A, the area provides the best site on the Earths surface for the conduct of a wide range of astronomical observations, from optical to millimetre wavelengths.
 Beneath the ice at Dome A and near the centre of the Antarctic Continent lie the unexplored Gamburtsev sub-glacial mountains. Study of these may contribute greatly to theoretical earth science and to understanding the geological history of Antarctica.
 Observations along the Zhongshan-Dome A are important for studying ice dynamic processes and mass balance, recent climate history and SolarWind/Magnetosphere/Ionosphere coupling.
 The ocean circulation in Prydz Bay is one of the major gyres around the Antarctic and it both affects and is affected by interaction beneath the Amery Ice Shelf. Improved oceanographic studies are required of the Prydz Bay circulation, its role in Southern Ocean circulation, and the potential impacts of change on both physical and biological systems.
What we will do for PANDA?
PANDA presents a integrated view of the Prydz Bay-Amery-Lambert glacier basin-Dome A system, with Chinese scientific and logistical leadership, partnership, coordination and cooperation for many international IPY efforts focused on this region and on Antarctica. Specifically, Chinese leadership and partnership as part of PANDA will support IPY through the following objectives:

- To construct a scientific research station at the summit of Dome A supporting future scientific programs in this region nationally and internationally.
- To establish a long-term observing/monitoring system for climate change research along the Prydz Bay, Amery Ice Shelf, Lambert glacier basin and Dome A transect, a data sparse region of Antarctica. This will involve partnerships with other meteorological, glaciological and oceanographic projects during IPY.
- To improve understanding on variability and physical processes of the ocean and sea ice in the Prydz Bay region, and on their response and feedback to climate change. This will involve partnership with the IPY SASSI programme.
- To understand processes of interaction between ocean and ice shelf and their effect on the stability of the ice shelf and ice sheet.
- To obtain a series of shallow ice cores between Zhongshan and Dome A for investigation of recent climate variability and change, and a medium depth ice core at Dome A.
- To determine site characteristics for deep ice core drilling at Dome A to potentially re-construct a 1.2M year climate record. This assessment during IPY will lead to new efforts to start deep ice core drilling in the summer of 2009/2010.
-To assess site characteristics at Dome A for astronomical observations.
-To find a suitable site for sub-glacial geological drilling in the Gamburtsev Mountains area.
-To establish a chain of magnetometers between Zhongshan and Dome A for studying the dynamics of the solar wind-magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling. This will include comprehensive upper atmosphere observations at Zhongshan Station and will involve cooperation with the IPY solar-earth coupling and magnetosphere dynamics programmes.

Many of these activities will leave a legacy of an infrastructure capability for international research after IPY.

Previous work at Zhongshan-Dome A, Amery Ice Shelf and Prydz Bay by CHINARE
During the last decade CHINARE has carried out following research work:
-Four inland traverses from the Zhongshan Station towards Dome A have been made in the summers of 1996/1997, 1997/1998,1998/1999 and 2004/2005. Glaciological observations were obtained and samples were obtained from shallow cores and snow pits along the route. During the latest traverse, the CHINARE team reached the summit of the Dome by snow mobiles. A series of measurements in glaciology and meteorology were carried out, and two automatic weather stations were installed in collaboration with Australia, one is at the summit of the Dome and one at the mid-point of the transect.
-Glaciological field programs have been conducted on the Amery Ice Shelf in the summers of 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005. The major work has included ice radar surveys of ice thickness, GPS measurements of ice velocity, estimation of ice shelf mass balance, recovery of a 296m ice core, and hydrographic observations along the edge of the Amery Ice Shelf.
-Physical oceanography, chemical oceanography, marine biology and geochemistry observations in the Prydz Bay region, have been carried out since 1989. A series of data have been obtained.
-Ground-based observations of the ionosphere (imaging riometer), optical aurora, geomagnetic fields, etc. have been carried out at Zhongshan Station for more than ten years.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">International Polar Year - A multitracer approach to study heat and salt fluxes through sea ice, pollutant transport and surface ocean hydrography</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The salt content of sea ice is a major control on many climatically and biologically relevant processes (e.g., summer melting rates and surface albedo, the equilibrium thickness of multi-year ice, the
formation of the brine channels that harbor microbial life in sea ice, the regulation of carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and ocean by maintaining brine network connectivity, the sea ice mechanical
strength and, radiation scattering within the ice). In this project, we propose to measure and model delta O18 and Lead-210 vertical profiles (together with internal temperature and salinity) to study
heat and brine fluxes through sea ice; two processes that are crucial for a better understanding of ice growth and melt dynamics. A unique aspect of the proposed work is that we will incorporate tracer
transport and fractionation into models of sea ice growth and melt. Towards this end, we propose to collect ice cores during the overwintering of the Amundsen ice breaker (Flaw Lead Polynya project), and to measure vertical profiles of temperature salinity, delta O18, and Lead-210 within each core. Tracer transport capabilities will be added to current dynamically and thermodynamically rigorous models of sea ice evolution. The modelled tracer profiles will then be used to reconstruct delta O18 values of the surface ocean along the past trajectory of the sea floe, and potential pollutant transport pathways within the Arctic Ocean. This proposal directly addresses the following major International Polar Year (IPY) objectives: (1) to advance our understanding of polar-global interactions by studying tele-connections on all scales, (2) to quantify, and understand, past and present environmental and human change in the polar regions in order to improve predictions, (3) to determine the present environmental status of the polar regions by quantifying their spatial and temporal variability, (4) to investigate the unknowns at the frontiers of science in the polar regions.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">ASI</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Arctic Social Indicators</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Arctic Social Indicators project (ASI) is a new project following up on the Arctic Human Development Report (AHDR). The ASI project seeks to devise indicators to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of human development in the Arctic, and is being developed under the auspices of the Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) of the Arctic Council. The project period is 2006-2008, with the final report being planned for late summer of 2008, and a presentation of results at the Sixth International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS IV) in Nuuk, Greenland.
The project’s main objective is to devise a limited set of indicators that reflect key aspects of human development in the Arctic, that are tractable in terms of measurement, and that can be monitored over time at a reasonable cost in terms of labour and material resources. The goal is to weigh the relative merits of a range of proposed indicators of human development in the Arctic, to select a number of indicators that seem most likely to prove successful in this context, and to test indicators with existing data and in discussions with representatives from various Arctic communities. The project, which covers the developmental stage in a long-term effort to measure and monitor human development on an integrated basis in the circumpolar Arctic can benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including those involved in Arctic policy making processes, residents of the North, and those engaged in the Arctic social sciences.
The scope and significance of the AHDR report has been recognized and widely praised both among those concerned with Arctic affairs and among those who deal with human development in the world at large. It presents a broad overview of the state of human development or social well-being in the circumpolar Arctic as of the early years of the 21st century, and as such, provides a baseline or a starting point from which to measure changes over time in the state of human development. The development of a suite of indicators was a part of the original vision of those who articulated the rationale for the development of the AHDR, but there was neither the time nor the material resources needed to produce a high quality product of this type. Therefore, the AHDR does not present quantifiable indicators suitable for monitoring or tracking changes in human development in the Arctic. There remains, however, an obvious need for indicators of this sort, and this is where the ASI follow-up project will seek to fill a critical gap.
When determining the usefulness of an indicator and deciding among a group of possible indicators we can look at whether the chosen indicators are generalizable and stable, easy to measure in a broadly accepted manner, and suitable for use in longitudinal analyses. Thus, the exercise of devising useful indicators is indeed a challenge. From this perspective, then, it is desirable to develop a small suite of indicators that capture the essential features of the phenomenon in question and can be measured empirically in a simple and intuitively appealing manner. The ASI working group has so far decided on six domains for the construction of social indicators, and team leaders have been assigned to each of these domains: (1) Fate control and or the ability to guide one’s own destiny; (2) Cultural integrity or belonging to a viable local culture; and (3) Contact with nature or interacting closely with the natural world. Three additional domains have been identified – namely, the domains used by the UNDP in constructing the Human Development Index: (4) Education; (5) Demography/Health; and (6) Material Well-being. The work on the construction of indicators for these six domains is now underway.
There will be a number of components to the project’s assessment strategy, which will include a consultation process and the testing of indicators using existing data and discussions with representatives from various Arctic communities. Community and indigenous feedback will be a critical part of the evaluation process.
The development of a report on Arctic Social Indicators will enable various stakeholders to evaluate trends that affect sustainable human development among residents of the Arctic over time. The ASI report will make it possible to compare and contrast conditions of human development throughout the Arctic. This will assist policymakers and the Arctic Council working groups to identify priorities. While the AHDR provided a baseline to human development in the Arctic, the proposed Arctic Social Indicator project will better enable the SDWG and policymakers at large to identify major changes relating to human development in the Arctic and hence provide a tool for measuring development, the effectiveness of policies and appropriateness of actions to address issues of human development.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Baltic Sea Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Baltic Sea experiment (BALTEX) is one of the five
continental-scale experiments of the Global Energy and Water
Cycle Experiment (GEWEX). BALTEX aims to provide a better
understanding of the processes of the climate system and to
improve and to validate the water cycle in regional numerical
models for weather forecasting and climate studies. A major
effort is undertaken to couple interactively the atmosphere with
the vegetated continental surfaces and the Baltic Sea including
its sea-ice. Major achievements have been obtained in an
improved understanding of related exchange processes. For the
first time an interactive atmosphere-ocean-land surface model
for the BALTEX area was tested.

The "Institut f?r Meereskunde" has been involved in BALTEX since
the beginning in several projects, comprehending both, modelling
and measuring activities. This includes the investigation of the
energy and water cycle from global numerical models like the
NCAR/NCEP-re-analysis projects as well as the development of a
fully coupled regional atmosphere-ocean model based on the
regional atmospheric model REMO and the coupled sea-ice-ocean
model BSIOM. Due to the lack of suitable instruments to measure
precipitation under high wind speeds, the development of a new
ship rain gauge started several years ago within the frame of
WOCE (World Ocean Experiment) and was completed within
BALTEX. This new type of ship rain gauges has been mounted on
several merchant ships travelling from Germany to Finland to
perform routinely precipitation measurements over the Baltic
Sea.

Major contributions to BALTEX have been provided by the IfM Kiel
through the EU Projects BASYS (Baltic Sea System Study,
1996-1999) and PEP (Pilot Study of Evaporation and Precipitation
in BALTEX, 1998-2000) and the BMBF-funded project Water Cycle
(1994- 2000). Within a DFG-funded project, the Kiel Baltic Sea
model (BSIOM) has been coupled to the regional atmospheric model
REMO to study the coupling mechanisms on a regional scale.

The major objective of the Bor Forest Island Fire Experiment was to conduct a high-intensity, stand replacement fire that would permit the documentation of fire behavior and effects in a manner that would allow comparison of eastern and western fire research methodologies. The major parameters investigated comprised:

   1. Fire ecology of Pinus sylvestris forests of the Sym Plain, including the long-term pollen and sediment records and a dendrochronology-derived fire history
   2. Vegetation and fuels (pre-fire and post-fire recovery, fuel loading and consumption, tree mortality)

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The purpose and long-term goal of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), a program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is to provide data, scientific assessments, and other information on the atmospheric composition and related physical characteristics of the background atmosphere from all parts of the globe. These are required to improve understanding of the behaviour of the atmosphere and its interactions with the oceans and the biosphere and will enable prediction of the future states of the earth-atmosphere system. GAW was established in 1989 as a coordinated system of networks of observing stations some of which began data-gathering in the 1950s and includes associated facilities and infrastructure encompassing measurement and related scientific assessment activities. The overall role of GAW is to supply basic information of known quality indicative of the atmospheric environment that transcends specific issues. The measurement programme includes: greenhouse gases, ozone (surface, total, and profile), radiation (including UV-B) and optical depth, precipitation chemistry, chemical and physical properties of aerosols, reactive gases, radionuclides, and related meteorological parameters. National and international policy decisions affecting the environment in the 21st century will thus rely heavily on the scientific data gathered through GAW. GAW is an integral part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) consisting of global stations located at remote pristine locations and regional stations for characterizing the regional environmental quality away from direct pollution sources. Also established are WMO World Data Centres for ozone and UV-B, radiation, aerosol optical depth, precipitation chemistry, greenhouse gases and all atmospheric gases except ozone, and aerosols. A concept of Quality Assurance/Science Activity Centres serves as a crucial link between the individual sampling sites - where the parameters are measured - and the ultimate data depositories (Data Centres) where the quality-assured data are archived and distributed.

The AGASP flights were special missions flown from Norway and
Thule AFB, to obtain measurements for determining the rate at
which carbon dioxide in the arctic atmosphere was being absorbed
by a Norwegian Sea "sink". Those sinks in oceans around the
world are believed to regularly absorb carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, and this absorption is believed to play an important
role in removing excess carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere. Computer models indicated that excess carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere from human activity would cause a "greenhouse"
effect; and we still are hearing about this of course, 17 years
later. The AGASP flights also determined how representative haze
samples were by comparing them to observations from ground based
instruments in an arctic air sampling network from the Barrow
GMCC observatory, which is a NOAA baseline monitoring station on
the North Coast of Alaska.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> Research Objectives of the Investigation of Sulfur Chemistry in
 Antarctic Troposphere (ISCAT):


 During this four-year study at Amundsen-Scott South Pole
 Station, we will examine the sulfur chemistry of the Antarctic
 atmosphere. The study involves two field seasons, the first of
 which was completed in 1998-1999. This field season (2000-2001)
 will be the second and last for this project. The study, which
 includes 10 principal and senior investigators at five
 institutions, with seven additional contributing investigators,
 has two broad-based goals: to improve substantially our current
 understanding of the oxidation chemistry of bioorganic sulfur
 in the polar environment, and to improve the climatic
 interpretation of sulfur-based signals in Antarctic ice-core
 records.

 The South Pole was selected because the atmospheric boundary
 layer at this site presents a homogeneous and relatively simple
 environment from which to unravel the photochemically driven
 oxidation chemistry of dimethyl sulfide. Atmospheric sulfur
 chemistry is an important component in climate change issues
 because both naturally (i.e., from volcanic emissions and
 oceanic phytoplankton production) and anthropogenically emitted
 sulfur compounds form minute particles in the atmosphere--the
 so-called aerosols--that reflect solar radiation, produce
 atmospheric haze and acid rain, and affect ozone
 depletion. Sulfate particles in the atmosphere may also act as
 condensation nuclei for water vapor and enhance global
 cloudiness. On the millennial time scale, the variability and
 natural background level of atmospheric aerosols can be
 reconstructed from the preserved paleorecords of sulfur
 oxidation products in ice cores. It is necessary, however, to
 understand how the physical and chemi!  cal environment of the
 oxidation process affects the relative concentrations of the
 oxidation products that become buried in the ice. This study
 requires simultaneous observations of a wide-ranging suite of
 sulfur species, such as DMS and its oxidation products, sulfur
 dioxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone, methane sulfonic
 acid, and sulfuric acid, as well as photochemically important
 compounds such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, water vapor,
 and non-methane hydrocarbons.

Secondary objectives will be:

to examine interior Antarctic air samples for other significant
DMS oxidation products, such as sulfurous acid and methane
sulfonic acid; and to assess the local variation in hydroxyl and
perhydroxyl radicals, a measure of the oxidizing power of the
atmosphere.  This study will provide, for the first time, a
quantitative picture of exactly which atmospheric sulfur
compounds are advected into the Antarctic interior and a
detailed picture of the sulfur chemistry that is active in the
Antarctic atmosphere.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Listening to the sound of the sea is an intense emotion. However the sound that we can hear from shore or aborad a boat, are just a little fraction of the thousands of “voices” of the sea.
Together with natural sounds, manmade sounds since about a century are an important part of the sound of the sea. Acoustic noise monitoring and the study of its variations as a function of time is a useful research tool to study marine environment and evaluate the “health of seas”.

Since about ten years, scientists from three Italian Institues INFN, INGV, CIBRA, and University “Sapienza” of Roma, carry out acoustic monitoring of sea with a new methodology: the installation of submarine microphones (hydrophones) antenna in deep sea, more than 2000 m water depth, off Eastern Sicilian Coast. These antennas detect acoustic signals that, using optical fibre cables, are continuously transmitted to shore where they are recorded and analyses. This experimental technique, developed by INFN to permit identification of subatomic particle (neutrinos) of astrophysical origin, has important follow-up in biology and geophysics.

The SMO Collaboiration, formed by INFN, University Sapienza of Rome, University Roma 3, INGV, and CIBRA is building a new acoustic antenna to be deployed at 3500 m water depth, off Capo Passero (South East Sicily) to study, with sensitive acoustic devices, deep sea sounds.

Project URL: http://www.birdhealth.nl/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=172

In short, the aim of the project is:
1. Study geographic variation in infections, parasites, immune system functioning and pollution levels in birds.
2. An effect study on individual marked birds
3. Modelling future scenario's of geographic variation and relating the findings to climate change, nature management and human health.

Healthy individuals are able to optimize resource use, survival and reproduction. Health of an individual will be under constant attack. Animals have developed immunological, physiological and behavioural strategies to battle these attacks from pathogens, parasites and/or pollution on their health. This battle for health is the main theme of the study. 

Individually marked birds are the subject of this study. They can be studied over their life time in the wild. Health of marked individuals can be correlated with present and future fitness. Experimental manipulations will quantify the consequences of specific attacks on health and will determine cause and effect in the correlations.

Ecological immunology is a fast developing field, with beautiful examples of individual and species differences in immune response. Population size and distribution is structured by pathogens, parasites and pollution, which effect on fitness often is a complex interaction in an evolution of the struggle for survival. Spatial and temporal variation between populations and individuals is the main focus of the study.

The polar regions are of special interest for this study. These areas are considered to have relatively low levels of pathogens, parasites and pollution. Migratory birds linking temperate regions with the Arctic are potential vectors of diseases as shown by the recent spread of the West Nile Virus and Avian Influenza: diseases which are threatening domestic animals and humans. With a changing arctic due to climate change and pollution, more knowledge is needed on how animals cope with attacks on their health.

In the IPY, we will classify the occurrence of pathogens, antibodies, parasites and pollution levels in individually marked wild birds in the Arctic and Antarctic. We will study the immune system by running tests on blood samples or by challenging the individuals and monitor the production of antibodies. Fitness of the birds is measured during sampling as reproductive output or body condition, but also later as e.g. survival. Health can be monitored over time when the individual is repeatedly seen or caught. Finally we will model temporal and spatial variation and relate our findings to climate change, nature management and human health.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An international collaborative effort to inventory and monitor biodiversity in the narrow inshore zone of the world's oceans at depths of less than 20 meters.

The Natural Geography In Shore Areas (NaGISA) is a collaborative effort aimed at inventorying and monitoring habitat specific biodiversity in the global near shore. The international character of the project and its target zone are reflected in the work nagisa, which is Japanese for the narrow coastal zone where the land meets the sea. NaGISA holds a unique position in the Census of Marine Life as an ambassador project, linking CoML to local interests around the world. NaGISA's first aim is to draw up an global baseline of biodiversity and then to use the network organized in that effort to continue monitoring those same shores for the next 50 years.

Methods and Technology
NaGISA used both passive and active sampling to assess quantitative/qualitative ecological/taxonomic information from the near shore zone. Employing a simple, cost-efficient and intentionally low-tech sampling protocol NaGISA will fulfill the goal of a series of well-distributed standard transects from the high intertidal zone to 20 meters water depth around the world by 2009. This is possible as the protocols are widely adaptable and have been adopted by research groups in many different countries (although new participants are always welcome!). The simple design of the protocols and unique nested hierarchy allows not only local community involvement but satisfies the technical/statistical needs of a global census.

NaGISA targets two specific habitats, rocky bottom macroalgal communities and soft bottom seagrass communities. Both complex globally occurring ecosystems that are currently far less well characterized than they should be. At each NaGISA study site, replicate samples are collected at the high, mid and low intertidal and at 1, 5 and 10m subtidal zones (15 and 20m are done whenever possible). There are two levels of target sampling -- both include measurement of surface and bottom seawater temperature and a visual classification of substrata.

    * 1. Non-invasive sampling using photography and observational techniques, percent cover estimates of colonial invertebrates and rhizoidal macroalgae and counts of algal stipes and solitary fauna within quadrats.
    * 2. Invasive sampling, or direct removal, consists of core samples taken within sea grass beds, and careful and complete removal of all organisms (macro and meio) from small quadrats within macroalgal sites.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Transantarctic Mountains Seismic Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports a project to evaluate geodynamic models for the tectonic development of Antarctica by investigating crust and upper mantle structure beneath the East-West Antarctic boundary. This experiment will use a focused broadband seismograph deployment to address two outstanding problems concerning the tectonic development of the Antarctic continent.

The origin of the Transantarctic Mountains. Even though the Transantarctic Mountains are widely considered a classic example of rift flank uplift, there appears to be little consensus about the exact uplift mechanism. Many mechanisms have been proposed, ranging from delayed phase changes to transform-flank uplift, all of which make various assumptions about upper mantle structure beneath and adjacent to the rift-side of the mountain front.

The structure of the East Antarctic Craton. East Antarctica displays the greatest modal elevation of any major cratonic block when corrected for glacial loading. The anomalous elevation of East Antarctica may have been an important factor in the onset of continental glaciation. However, the support mechanism for this anomalous topography is unknown; possible models include isostatic uplift from (a) thickened crust, (b) anomalously depleted upper mantle, and (c) thermally modified upper mantle, as well as dynamic uplift. The lateral extent of the very old continental lithosphere is also uncertain. In particular, it is unknown whether the old lithosphere extends to the western edge of East Antarctica beneath the crustal rocks deformed during the Ross Orogeny. 
To examine details of the crust and upper mantle structure across the East-West Antarctic boundary, this passive seismic experiment is comprised of three elements: (1) A 1400 km linear array of 17 broadband seismic stations extending from the high central regions of the East Antarctic craton to the Transantarctic Mountains (Array 1). (2) An intersecting 400 km linear array of 16 broadband seismic stations extending from the coast across the Transantarctic mountains nearly perpendicular to the strike of the range in the dry valleys region (Array 2). (3) An array of 11 broadband stations in coastal regions around Ross Island and Terra Nova Bay (Array 3).

This experiment will be conducted over a three-year period, to allow sufficient data collection from naturally occurring earthquakes, and will begin in November 2000. Airborne surveys for surface elevation and ice thickness will be completed in support of this work. If feasible, aerogravity and aeromagnetics data will also be collected. Data will be analyzed using a variety of proven modeling techniques, including body and surface wave tomography, receiver function inversion, and shear wave splitting analysis. The results of these analyses will be maps of the variation in crustal thickness, upper mantle structure, anisotropy, and mantle discontinuity topography across the boundary of East and West Antarctica. These results will provide a solid foundation for understanding the geodynamics of the Antarctic continent.

This report summarizes the progress of the IMS to date and presents some recommendations on information transfer and research operations for improving the IMS program. Milestones in the organization of the IMS are reviewed along with basic and applied research dealing with various cause-and-effect relationships among the dynamical processes that govern particle, momentum, and energy transfer between the solar wind, the magnetosphere, and the upper atmosphere. Coordination of the IMS on a worldwide basis is discussed, particularly with respect to the different national, bilateral, and multinational programs. The dedicated IMS satellite, ground-based, balloon, and rocket programs are briefly examined, and the functions of the IMS Steering Committee, Satellite Situation Center, Central Information Exchange Office, and World Data Centers are described. Attention is also given to real-time data acquisition and display systems, satellite-data availability, and Steering Committee recommendations regarding data analysis and interpretation.

Perhaps the most lasting product of the scientific output from the 1st International Polar Year (IPY) are the encyclopaedic ethnological reports resulting from expeditions to Pt. Barrow, Alaska and Fort Chimo in the Ungava District (now northern Quebec). Together, John Murdoch's Ethnological Results of the Point Barrow Expedition (1892) and Turner's Ethnology of the Ungava District (1894) form the intellectual bedrock of northern native studies in their respected regions. These publications are likely the only research results from the original IPY which still are consulted routinely by researchers. The volumes have limitations as ethnological studies; they provide a comprehensive and valuable review of the material culture of Barrow's Inupiat residents and the Inuit and Innu of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula at the time of the first IPY. Both books are highly regarded by contemporary northern native community members across Alaska's North Slope and throughout the Eastern Canadian Arctic. 
We propose a modern version of these ethnological collecting projects. Using the categories developed by Murdoch and Turner, with a few additions (e.g. communications equipment, navigation devices), the project will document modern equivalents of the items Murdoch collected, how they are manufactured or obtained, and their uses. Photographic (digital) and written documentation will require modest expenditures. 
It is possible that much of the documentation can be accomplished as part of the school curriculum, involving students with Elders, or as part of a summer/after school program. It could also provide excellent material for science fair projects. A number of educators have expressed interest in incorporating the data collection process into broader educational endeavours. This idea builds on an existing exchange program between a Barrow, Alaska classroom, and in one in Munich, Germany. The idea can be used by any two classes or schools (at least one Northern), and we are planning to facilitate the finding of partners and exchange of ideas through the website. The idea is that two groups of children will be writing about themselves (including the material culture of their community) and asking about their partners. On one hand this will make them aware about their own culture and the differences of the other, and on the other hand it will open their minds to respect people of the other culture. So we will have junior ethnologists exploring the others on their own level. In the Barrow/Munich collaboration, the plans are for a focus on Alaska in English and Geography classes in Munich for several months, culminating in a presentation for parents. The materials exchanged would then be analyzed by older students (12 &amp; 13th year) under the supervision of an ethnologist, ultimately leading to a book from children to children on the two cultures. While we do not expect most school pairs to go this far, the general idea can be used at a more limited scale by individual teachers. 
If there is interest on the part of a museum (The Anchorage Museum or the Smithsonian Institution where the original IPY collections are held) and funding is obtained for conservation and curation costs, then in addition to documentation, the project could collect examples of reasonably sized items (i.e. no airplanes or front-end loaders), with a view to an exhibition on technology, then and now. This exhibit would be designed so that at least part of it could travel widely, including to Northern communities. Small teaching collections for classroom use will be obtained.
The project also will attempt to duplicate photographs, ethnographic and otherwise, taken by the 1st IPY expedition in the Barrow area and in Kujjuaqq (and at other IPY stations if there is interest). Sturm and his colleagues (2001), as well as many others, have demonstrated that comparative analyses of photographs taken at the same locations over periods of generations are productive in assessing long-term landscape changes.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The climate response to variability in volcanic aerosols and solar irradiance, the primary forcings during the preindustrial era, is examined in a stratosphere-resolving general circulation model. The best agreement with historical and proxy data is obtained using both forcings, each of which has a significant effect on global mean temperatures. However, their regional climate impacts in the Northern Hemisphere are quite different. While the short-term continental winter warming response to volcanism is well known, it is shown that due to opposing dynamical and radiative effects, the long-term (decadal mean) regional response is not significant compared to unforced variability for either the winter or the annual average. In contrast, the long-term regional response to solar forcing greatly exceeds unforced variability for both time averages, as the dynamical and radiative effects reinforce one another, and produces climate anomalies similar to those seen during the Little Ice Age. Thus, long-term regional changes during the preindustrial appear to have been dominated by solar forcing.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network (AIRMoN) is an
array of stations designed to provide a research-based foundation for the
routine operations of the nation's deposition monitoring networks -- the
National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) for wet deposition, and the
Clean Air Status and Tends Network (CASTNet) for dry. A subprogram is
specifically designed to detect the benefits of emissions controls
mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and to quantify these
benefits in terms of deposition to sensitive areas.

AIRMoN combines two previously-existing deposition research networks that
have appropriate characteristics (previously known as the MAP3S
precipitation chemistry network and the CORE/satellite Dry Deposition
Inferential Method network) under a single operational umbrella, so as to
generate a new monitoring activity to which on-line modeling and analysis
can be easily applied. An air-sampling component of AIRMoN provides some
unique information on changes in air quality.

AIRMoN has been endorsed, in principle, by both the National Acid
Precipitation Assessment Program and NOAA. To get started on the endeavor,
the daily-sampling precipitation chemistry research program, previously
operated under the auspices of the Department of Energy was transferred to
NOAA (the MAP3S program). Plans for AIRMoN were endorsed during 1992 by
NOAA and by the Department of Commerce, and were accepted by OMB as an
important contribution to NAPAP and to the debate about the consequences
of the Clean Air Act Amendments controls. The activity was subsumed into a
funding package now well recognized NOAA's "Health of the Atmosphere"
initiative, and is widely viewed as a central piece in NOAA's
"environmental stewardship" portfolio.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The aims of the seismic reflection and refraction surveys in the Weddell Sea
are:
a) to develop a model on the break-up of this part of Gondwana,
b) to map the ocean-continent boundary,
c) to develop an idea about the evolution of the area since the break-up of
Gondwana,
d) to map the sediment distribution and the seismostratigraphy of the region
in order to reconstruct major oceanic current systems.

Shot interval varies between 25 m and 30 m for the seismic reflection and 75
m and 150 m for the seismic refraction data. Since the data have been collected
over a long period of time, they are in various stages of processing up to
migration.

The following instruments were used:
800 and 3000 m long streamer(24 and 96 channel), 6,24 l airgun arrays,
3 l GI gun, 32 l airgun, 6-channel Reftek stations with 3-component
seismometer and geophone arrays.

The geographical coverage is as follows:
about 10000 km of seismic reflection and about 1500 km of seismic refraction
data have been collected in the Weddel Sea, Antarctica.
These data cover the entire region from shelf to deep sea.

Data are available on request, but with special arrangement.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
On April 16, 1985, a Protocol for Scientific and Technical
Cooperation in Surveying and Mapping Studies between the
National Bureau of Surveying and Mapping (NBSM) of the Peoples
Republic of China (PRC) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
was signed in Washington, D.C. to cover a period of 5
years. This signing was in accordance with the general
agreement between the U.S. Government and the Government of the
PRC on Cooperation in Science and Technology that was signed in
Washington, D.C., in January 1979, and extended by agreement in
January 1984. In April 1990, the Protocol was extended for 1
year, extended in April 1991 for 5 years to April 1996, and
extended again in April 1996 for another 5 years to April 2001,
to coincide with the same time period of the umbrella S&amp;T
agreement between the USA and the PRC. The Protocol, which
contains four annexes (Annex II, III, IV, and V), is intended
to promote scientific and technical cooperation in
photogrammetry, remote sensing !  cartography, geographic
information systems, and map production management, and the
observation, development, and processing of geodetic and
geophysical data.

Meetings of the Joint Working Group for Scientific and
Technical Cooperation in Surveying and Mapping Studies are held
every year to introduce the latest developments, review the
past year's cooperative activities, and develop the work plans
for each Annex for the coming year. It was announced at the
August 1998 meeting that the NBSM has changed its name to the
State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping (SBSM).

Recent achievements under the above annexes include the release
of small-scale topographic maps and data that were previously
not releasable. Environmental information over China at
1:4,000,000 scale and 1:1,000,000 scale is now available
because of these efforts. Earth gravity data, which was
previously unavailable, is now being exchanged. China now
participates on several international standards committees for
cartographic data and is a significant consumer of
U.S. computers and software used for GIS. In addition, the SBSM
has recently signed a cooperative agreement with the Census
Bureau for the PRC, and is planning to give mapping support to
their work modeled on the USGS/Census cooperation in the
U.S. SBSM is working on ways to use their GIS expertise and
data to meet the needs of construction and water control
projects to aid in disaster management such as floods.

The Protocol is important to USA and PRC exchange activities
because of the basic relationship of surveying and mapping
information to many other Protocols in existence between the
two countries. Moreover, remote sensing and geographic
information systems are developing technologies that are
important to future USGS programs which can benefit from broad
applications and cooperative exchange of information.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Global CMT Project (formerly Harvard CMT Project)</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">During the summer of 2006, the main activities of the research project known as the Harvard Centroid-Moment-Tensor (CMT) Project moved with Principal Investigator Goran Ekstrom from Harvard University to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University. Adam Dziewonski, the founder and co-Principal Investigator of the CMT project, is at Harvard University. The third active participant in the CMT project is Meredith Nettles at LDEO, Columbia University. The Harvard CMT Project is moving forward under the name "The Global CMT Project". The main dissemination point for information and results from the project is the web site http://www.globalcmt.org/.

The Global CMT Project involves four main activities: 

1. Systematic determination, with a three-to-four-month delay, of moment tensors for earthquakes with M&gt;5 globally, and accumulation of the results in the CMT catalog.

2. Rapid determination of moment tensors for earthquakes with M&gt;5.5 globally and quick dissemination of results ("quick CMTs").

3. Curation of the CMT catalog, which contains more than 25,000 moment tensors for earthquakes since 1976.

4. Development and implementation of improved methods for the quantification of earthquake source characteristics on a global scale.


The Global Centroid Moment Tensor database, a forms query, was formerly known as the Harvard CMT catalog. The main database runs from January, 1976, to about 6 months before the present. Also included in this search are the Quick CMTs (from the end of the main catalog through the present). For more information on CMTs, see the CMT project web page. 

The CMT project has been continuously funded by the National Science Foundation since its inception, and is currently supported by award EAR-0639963.

Nature-GIS is a network bringing together the different
stakeholders in protected areas: users and experts in IT and in
nature conservation. Its objectives are: improving reporting on the
implementation of the EU policies, raising awareness on GI-GIS in
this field, supporting access to data and information. The
objectives will be actualised into a reference outcome, "Technical
guidelines for data infrastructures for protected areas", a
companion product for operators, whose content will be verified
through web access to structured geoinformation on protected areas
using OpenGIS technology. Through Conferences, its website,
Newsletters and other means Nature-GIS will operate an operational
network able to involve new external users and to carry out actions
of dissemination at different levels to diffuse the obtained
achievements and to propose them to all operators in this field.
It is intended to become a permanent and structured group active in
the field of GIS for protected areas.

The objectives of the project are:

- to offer a contribution to improve information for EU policy
making and evaluation, particularly for improving reporting related
to the implementation of the EU Nature Protection and Biodiversity
policy area;

- to offer as well a contribution to raise awareness regarding the
use of GI-GIS in this field. The proposal should be seen in the
larger frame of its contribution to the different European
documents and conventions that require research, identification and
exchange of information to ease and promote conservation of
biodiversity;

- as per the VI Environmental Action Plan, to contribute to develop
and broaden the dialogue among all levels of responsibility, from
the EU to the local level, e.g. will support public access to data
and information, in the EU and in the new Accession countries. Very
operationally, Nature-GIS could become a focal point to identify
specific GI-GIS requirements for "Nature Conservation &amp;
Biodiversity" in the E-ESDI development.

The Coastal Change Analysis Program is designed to monitor change in
terrestrial land cover and nearshore benthic resources within coastal
environments of the United States including the Atlantic, Pacific, and
Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, Alaska, Hawaii, and all
U.S. Territories and possessions.  C-CAP classifies types of land
cover, analyzes and monitors changes in coastal submerged habitats,
wetland habitats, and adjacent uplands using remote sensing techniques
(satellite imagery and aerial photography).  Through this analysis,
scientists can correlate the changes in terrestrial regions with those
in coastal aquatic habitats, and with changes in the distribution,
abundance, and health of living marine resources.  The program is
managed through the NOAA Coastal Services Center in Charleston, South
Carolina, in coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service
Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina, and with technical support
from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

With a view to documenting the long term changes in composition of
trace species of the atmosphere as a result of changing land use
pattern, WMO had commissioned a global programme called Background Air
Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) which is now a part of the
Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Programme. India had set up 10 such
BAPMon stations.

At these stations, rain water samples are collected every month and
these are sent to the Central Chemical Laboratory at Pune for complete
chemical analysis.  Acidity of rain and mineral deposition is
determined from these.

Atmospheric turbidity which indicates the columnar aerosol load of the
atmosphere, is also measured at these stations using sunphotmeters.
These data are important for identifying the current levels of
pollution as well as for study of the long term trends in the
concentration of trace constituents of the atmosphere which may affect
the environment and induce a climate change.

To study the impact of industrialisation, urbanisation and terrain
modification on micro-climatological features of urban areas, urban
climatological studies are carried out in metropolitan cities.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Weddell Sea is part of the Southern Ocean. Its land boundaries are defined by the bay formed from the coasts of Coats Land and the Antarctic Peninsula. Much of the southern part of the sea, up to Elephant Island, is permanent ice, the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. The sea is contained within the two overlapping Antarctic territorial claims of Argentina, (Argentine Antarctica) and Britain (British Antarctic Territory), and also resides partially within the territorial claim of Chile (Antarctic Chilean Territory). At its widest the sea is around 2,000 km across, in area it is around 2.8 million km².

The sea is named after the British sailor James Weddell who entered the sea in 1823 as far as 74° S. It was first widely explored by the Scot William S. Bruce over 1902-04.

It was in this sea that Shackleton's ship, the Endurance was trapped and crushed by ice in 1915.

The ice shelves which used to extend roughly 3900 square miles (10,000 km²) over the Weddell Sea have completely disappeared by 2002.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In a June 2004 issue of the journal Nature a team of researchers from NASA&amp;#039;s Goddard Space Flight Center, the University of Maryland, the World Wildlife Fund, Stanford University, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Bowie State University published an analysis of global patterns in human consumption of net primary productivity (NPP). NPPthe net amount of solar energy converted to plant organic matter through photosynthesiscan be measured in units of elemental carbon and represents the primary food energy source for the world&amp;#039;s ecosystems. Human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP), through the consumption of food, paper, wood and fiber, alters the composition of the atmosphere, levels of biodiversity, energy flows within food webs and the provision of important ecosystem services. A more detailed paper presenting similar results was published by the NASA lead researchers (Imhoff and Bounoua) in a November 2006 article in the Journal of Geophysical Research (see citation section below). 

This Web site provides access to the spatial data sets utilized in the Nature and JGR articles: the original satellite-derived quarter-degree NPP grid (Figure 1); the intermediate model of human appropriation of NPP (low and high variants of HANPP were also produced but are not distributed here) (Figure 2); and the HANPP as a percent of NPP (Figure 3). The data are available in raster GRID and Compressed GeoTIFF formats. In addition, a downloadable Excel format file provides tabular data by country on total estimated consumption of NPP in the form of food, paper, wood, and fiber.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This project addresses the question of how extensive land use change or more subtle regional climate variations modify the natural functioning and structure of the Amazonian ecosystems, from routing of water and its chemical load through precipitation and drainage systems back to the atmosphere and the oceans. The biogeochemical and hydrological processes of this and other continental-scale tropical regions may function in fundamentally different ways than the better-known temperate or boreal regions of the world. The focus of this project is to model, within the context of land-cover changes, the transport and distribution of water, sediment and bioactive chemicals along the Amazon valley network and the transfer of biogenic gases between the land surface and the atmosphere along with mobilization of particulate matter through the river system to the ocean.

Project URL: http://www.narwhal.org/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=164

Scientists with myriad backgrounds and Inuit elders with traditional knowledge will integrate results , insights and observations to explain the expression of teeth in the narwhal. The extraordinary tusk defies most of the principles and properties of teeth and remains a scientific enigma. Findings about its form and function will add to the evolutionary knowledge for this odd adaptation and will, because of unique findings of anatomy and histology recently discovered by this team, further define sensory capabilities of mammalian teeth. Scientific results have already begun to direct interest in future models of dental material design as the hard tissue of the narwhal tusk possesses a combination of unusual flexibility and strength characteristics that is highly desirable in restorative materials. These same tusk traits were observed by the Inuit before the laboratory testing was completed, and the results were reported. Likewise, traditional knowledge elucidates many aspects of narwhal anatomy, function, migration and social behavior. Both the knowledge of Inuit elders and the findings of scientists are needed for a more complete understanding of the narwhal, Qilalugaq qernertaq. 

Scientific studies in anatomy, morphology, histology, physiology, genetics, cellular biology and narwhal social behavior are currently being conducted by the principal investigator and collaborators to elucidate tusk function. Anatomical variations of narwhal will be described from field and laboratory dissection, computerized scans (CT, MRI and micro-CT), analysis of museum specimens, and interviews with Inuit elders. Photographic morpho-metric analysis of narwhal skeletal collections at the Museum of Nature in Canada, Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, the Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History has been initiated, and we are seeking other institutions that may have additional collections, particularly those with rare specimens. Anatomic plates of narwhal anatomy will be completed based on all these collected findings. 

On October 28, 2006, a panel discussion was presented by the principal investigator, Paniloo Sangoya and David Angnatsiak from the community of Pond Inlet at the 15th International Inuit Studies Conference in Paris, France. Future joint presentations with the principal investigator and Inuit elders will be encouraged and planned to express the value of scientific collaboration with Inuit elders in marine mammal research.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">IPY FIELD STATIONS</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Polar Field Stations and IPY History: Culture, Heritage, Governance (1882-Present)'</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In the present project a team of researchers from six nations will study the history and legacy of IPY through its field stations. (For a more full-bodied description of our approach and themes of study, see EoI 686, January 2005.)
Field stations have been one of the most salient and tangible features of IPYs since 1882-83 and through to the coming IPY 2007-08. The polar station is a modern feature, the smaller field cousin of the Laboratory, Instrument, or Observatory. It is a nexus, and a place, where a number of central features of the modern scientific enterprise – laboratory practices and methods, precision instruments, territorial claims – meet in the landscape and sometimes in close vicinity of local groups and populations. Field stations, and the scientific expeditions that created them and used them as vantage points, are inseparable from polar research. They form important parts of the infrastructure of polar research in the past two centuries. They have also served as flag carriers, and as symbols of political, diplomatic and economic ambitions of the nations to which their founders belonged.
However, field stations remain a surprisingly neglected element in the study of the creation of scientific knowledge, and in relation to science diplomacy and geopolitical conflict and cooperation. We know quite little of the bipolar archipelagoes of IPY stations and their significance, some of them more than a century old. We are yet not sufficiently clear about their status as legacies of past ambitions, or as heritage in landscapes which were shared by science with local groups and indigenous peoples.
In this project we will approach field stations from a range of disciplinary vantage points. At the heart of our concerns are field stations as units of knowledge production in the field. This is particularly pertinent to the IPY legacy. Cooperation in sharing field data is an ideal that has run through previous IPYs, and it has been given special prominence in the IPY 2007-2008 Framework. The original idea of IPY emerged from a recognition that individual studies in the field sciences only contribute to a larger picture with a great deal of work. Field stations are one of the chief means by which a sustained presence in the field is maintained: field sites, instruments, and the movement of personnel are carefully coordinated; projects are vetted within research communities through systems of peer review; research efforts are directed with an eye to agendas decided by policymakers. Another thing is the way that contact and collaboration between researchers and disciplines is influenced by the specifics of the field station, including management practices and physical design, which evidently has significant implications for field stations and knowledge production.
In the project we intend to use the International Polar Year 2007-2008 as an opportunity to identify and analyse the work (e.g. planning, calibrating, publishing, management, hidden labour, sharing data) required to make field observations meaningful across a range of scales and contexts of users or audiences. The IPY 2007-08 represents a singular opportunity to understand how the field sciences have generated a scientific and cultural legacy. We will analyse former and present research station sites, including important non-IPY sites, to understand how the residues of scientific practice become valid knowledge, collective memory and heritage. We will also study the contemporary and past role of field-stations in establishing patterns of management-labour interactions, work rules and customs, and attitudes toward jobs, for modern, non-subsistence employment in communities which have hosted or interacted with stations. For some stations, only archival work is possible.
Among a range of IPY proposals which are in different ways connected to this one (see further under 3.2), our project links up in particular with the LASHIPA project (EoI 636). LASHIPA studies industrial, mining, and whaling stations and sites in the polar regions, some of which are also related to IPY history. In this way the “station” comes out not just as the site of different forms of production (of knowledge, goods, and perceptions), but also as a theoretical concept: the physical manifestation of Western knowledge and its specific relationships of nature and culture, time and place, the physical and the spiritual. In combination, the two projects (686 and 636) provide a comprehensive and novel approach to the geography of human presence and IPY encounters in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">SCAR King George Island GIS Project</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">King George Island is one of the South Shetland Islands. It is located close to
the Northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The island is dominated by a huge
ice cap. More than 90% of the island are glaciated. The ice-free areas and
coastal zones of the island carry a diverse plant and animal life. Penguins,
seals, petrels and a comparable rich vegetation make the island's natural
environment not only a favorite for tourist cruises.

King George Island has also the greatest concentration of multinational
research activities in Antarctica. Human activities on the island are based on
nine permanent stations and an airstrip maintained by the Chilean airforce.

Probably nowhere else in Antarctica the need for coordinated approaches in
research activities and environmental management is more evident than on King
George Island. This is reflected by Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research's (SCAR) recommendation SCAR XXVI-6 adopted at the XXVIth Meeting of
SCAR in Tokyo, July 2000, that calls for efforts to integrate scientific
objectives and for collaboration among the nations working on the island. The
SCAR King George Island GIS (SCAR KGIS) project provides a fundamental
contribution to these endeavors.

The project makes available an integrated geographic database for use by all
countries and in multi-disciplinary applications. It is coordinated under the
Geographic Information Program of the SCAR Geospatial Information Group.

Currently the project is hosted at and coordinated by Institut f. Physische
Geographie, University Freiburg, Germany.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Accurate simulation of ice-sheet surface mass balance requires higher spatial resolution than is afforded by typical atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs), owing, in particular, to the need to resolve the narrow and steep margins where the majority of precipitation and ablation occurs. We have developed a method for calculating mass-balance changes by combining ice-sheet average time-series from AOGCM projections for future centuries, both with information from high-resolution climate models run for short periods and with a 20 km ice-sheet mass-balance model. Antarctica contributes negatively to sea level on account of increased accumulation, while Greenland contributes positively because ablation increases more rapidly. The uncertainty in the results is about 20% for Antarctica and 35% for Greenland. Changes in ice-sheet topography and dynamics are not included, but we discuss their possible effects. For an annual- and area-average warming exceeding  in Greenland and  in the global average, the net surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet becomes negative, in which case it is likely that the ice sheet would eventually be eliminated, raising global-average sea level by 7 m.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus Phase II</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus Phase II:
Entrainment Studies (DYCOMS-II) is the name given to a field
campaign which proposes to collect data for the purposes of
testing large-eddy simulations of nocturnal
stratocumulus. DYCOMS-II will be based on measurements taken from
the NCAR EC-130Q in and around nocturnal marine
stratocumulus. The experiment will consist of 9 flights out of
North Island Naval Air Station (just west of San Diego) between
July 7 and July 28, 2001. Eight of these flights will be
nocturnal. For more information about the experimental objectives
and strategy, as well as references and contacts click on the
appropriate link below.

Objectives:

1. The DYCOMS-II field program is designed to collect data to
test large-eddy simulations of stratocumulus

2. To test a recently proposed technique to measure large-scale
divergence

3. To test our ability to close scalar budgets under ideal
situations

4. To increase our understanding and of the statistical signature
of the diurnal cycle in marine stratocumulus

Strategies:

Our basic strategy is to make use of a unique combination of
instrumentation and flight plans to measure both the large-scale
environment and the turbulent dynamics of summertime, nocturnal,
subtropical marine stratocumulus.

Instruments:

1. EC-130Q Hercules: This four-engine, medium-size utility
turboprop has been modified from a U.S. military tactical
aircraft to a versatile and capable research platform that will
deliver the scientific instrumentation to the target area. The
Hercules has a 10-hour flight endurance, covers a 2,900 nautical
mile range at 20,000 ft, and carries a payload of up to 23,000
lb. In addition to the standard sensors that measure atmospheric
state parameters, cloud physics, and radiation, the C-130 will be
equipped with specialized instrumentation for measuring the state
of the atmosphere away from the aircraft. These latter
instruments include the Staring (Scanning) Aerosol Backscatter
Lidar (SABL), the ATD Dropwindsonde System, and the Wyoming cloud
radar.

2. GPS Dropsondes: These third-generation dropsonde, use a new
sensor module and a GPS receiver from Vaisala Inc. A unique
square-cone parachute is used to reduce the initial shock load
and slow and stabilize the sonde. The parachute is immediately
deployed on exit from the launch chute and streamers for about
five seconds until filled by ram-air. The stability of the square
cone parachute is very good during the sonde's descent and
reduces or eliminates any pendulum motion of the sonde. The fall
speeds of the sondes in the subtropical boundary layer are
estimated to be between 10 and 15 m/s, yielding profiles with a
resolution of less than 10m. Four sondes can be tracked from the
aircraft simultaneoulsy.

3.  Scanning Aerosol Backscatter Lidar (SABL): The SABL lidar is
a compact and reliable instrument that detects backscatter from
air molecules, aerosols, and hydrometeors (water and ice) and is
used to measure and map distributions of relative aerosol
concentrations. The instrument operates at two wavelengths 532
(green) and 1064 nm (infrared). On the C130 aircraft, it operates
from zenith to nadir out to distances from 10 to 15 km with range
resolutions down to 7.5 meters and along-track resolution to 4
meters. The lidar is not eye-safe and thus its scanning
capabilities are currently limited. During DYCOMS-II it will be
mounted on a pod on a wing of the C130 and will be used primarily
in a downward staring mode to provide information about cloud top
structure. Craig Walther and Bruce Morley of NCAR lead the SABL
development.

4. Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR): The Wyoming Cloud Radar is an
observational system for the study of cloud structure and
composition. It is intended for airborne use; principally on the
Wyoming KingAir. Operating at 95 GHz (3 mm wavelength), the radar
provides high-resolution measurements of reflectivity, velocity
and polarization fields in vertical or horizontal
sections. Coupled with the in situ observations of hydrometeors
and air motions from the same aircraft these data yield unique
information for analyses of cloud and precipitation
processes. During DYCOMS it is proposed that the radar will be
mounted on the C130. Gabor Vali of the University of Wyoming is
the primary contact for the implementation of the WCR during
DYCOMS-II.

5. Tunable Diode Laser (TDL): The tunable diode laser was
developed by Randall May of Spectra Sensors. The prototype
instrument is shown below mounted on the DC-8. The TDL on the
C-130 is mounted under a wing pod. The TDL is an open-path
instrument that makes independent water vapor measurements every
125 ms. Although as currently configured these measurements are
averaged together to provide data at 1Hz, during DYCOMS each
independent sample will be saved. The resultant 8Hz data should
be sufficient for measuring fluxes outside of the surface
layer. Previous experience with the prototype instrument during
CAMEX, and experience with the current instrument on 30 flights
during TOPSE suggests that it performs very well and should
provide unprecedented measurements of water-vapor in and around
the marine boundary layer, both in and out of clouds. Bruce
Gandrud of NCAR is a primary contact for the implementation of
the TDL.

6. Fast Ozone: The NCAR NO chemiluminesence techique for
measureing Ozone has been recently modified to increase its
frequency response. Preliminary tests with a cylindric reaction
chamber indicate a frequency response of 5.5Hz with 1 ppbv of
sensitivity. Tests with a conic reaction chamber have an slightly
improved frequency response (6.5Hz) and a slightly reduced (4
ppbv) sensitivity. The lead developer of this instrument is
Teresa Campos of NCAR.

7. Fast DMS (APIMS): The atmospheric pressure ionization mass
  spectrometer (APIMS) has been developed by Alan Bandy and
  colleagues at Drexel University. The method is based on mass
  spectrometry using atmospheric pressure ionization as a source
  of ions, and uses deuterated DMS as an internal standard. This
  internal standard allows monitoring of the DMS mixing ratio
  directly, which is a significant advantage in flux
  determinations using eddy correlation. The instrument
  sensitivity is about 100 counts per second per pptv. At a
  typical DMS concentration of 100 pptv, the count rate is 104
  counts per second. At a sample rate of 40 samples per second
  this is 250 counts per sampling interval. This yields a
  signal-to-noise of about 16 since the blank is negligible. The
  instrument was first flown on test flights in November of 1999,
  and we are hopeful that a second round of test flights
  scheduled for August 2000 will demonstrate the capability of
  the DMS instrument for entrainment mea!  surements.

8. Particulate Volume Monitor (PVM-100A): The PVM is a cloud
   microphysics probe designed to measure for small droplets the
   liquid water content (LWC), droplet surface area (PSA), and
   droplet effective radius (Re); see Fig. 1 (below). The PVM
   makes these measurements optically on a cloud volume of about
   10 cm^3, thus minimizing statistical sampling errors; and the
   measurements are independent of air speed. The accuracy of the
   PVM is estimated to be better than 10% for droplet spectra
   with VMD (volume medium diameter) smaller than 30 um, and the
   precision is on the order of 0.002 g/m^3. The PVM has the
   unique capability of making these measurements at a rate
   several orders of magnitude faster than other methods. An
   example of 1000-Hz LWC measurements made with the PVM on the
   C-130 during SCMS (Small Cumulus Microphysics Study) is shown
   in Fig. 2 . This 10-cm resolution LWC data show a large amount
   of fine scale in-cloud structure not seen in the 1-Hz data
   often collected with!  other probes. The planned PVM data
   collection rate for DYCOMS-II is 2000 Hz, which gives 5-cm
   in-cloud resolution. This will be useful in studying the fine
   scales potentially associated with the entrainment
   process. Also accurate and fast LWC measurements can be
   combined with vertical velocity measurements from a gust probe
   to estimate the entrainment velocity into the Sc using a
   q-conservation method described earlier by Steve Nicholls.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The stimulus for Processes and Resources of the Eastern Bering Sea Shelf (PROBES) was a mutual US - Japan scientific concern about the ability of the Bering Sea to support the huge annual catch, on a sustained basis, of groundfish, pelagic fish, crab and other marine resources. The question was large enough to demand the attention of oceanographic disciplines from both countries as well as from others. After several conferences, it was decided to emphasize the &amp;Golden Triangle&amp; (the are encompassed southeastern Bering Sea shelf in an attempt to understand the bioproductivity of this region (Hood and Kelley 1974, Hood and Takenouti 1975). In the beginning, it appeared most expedient, for logistic and funding reasons, to have each country pursue its part of the program independently.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A six year program, with a budget of $6 million, was undertaken by the Office of Sea Grant in 1976 to develop improved engineering predictive models for transport of sediment in and near the surf zone by waves and currents. The project, called the Nearshore Sediment Transport Study, has involved ten investigators from six different institutions who worked cooperatively on field studies. Three major field experiments have been conducted, the first in 1978, the second in 1980, and the last in 1981. The first two field experiments had a duratioon of approximately a month and involved synoptic measurements of more than 100 parameters of surf zone dynamics and sediment response. Sand tracer experiments were also performed and the last two field sites include concurrent trap experiments for longshore transport. All data were recorded on magnetic tape and more than a billion words were obtained in the second experiment. In the final two years of the project, emphasis has been placed on the formation of predictive models and their verification using the NSTS data sets.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The National Seismic Hazard mapping Project (NSHMP) is a project
developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS)which
involves the development of hazard maps showing the likely risk
of seismic activity throughout the United States.

The map here depict earthquake hazard by showing, by contour
values, the earthquake ground motions that have a common given
probability of being exceeded in 50 years.

The ground motions being considered at a given location are
those from all future possible earthquake magnitudes at all
possible distances from that location. The ground motion coming
from a particular magnitude and distance is assigned an annual
probability equal to the annual probability of occurrence of the
causative magnitude and distance.

The method assumes a reasonable future catalog of earthquakes,
based upon historical earthquake locations and geological
information on the recurrence rate of fault ruptures.

When all the possible earthquakes and magnitudes have been
considered, one can find a ground motion value such that the
annual rate of its being exceeded has a certain value. Hence, on
a given map, for a given probability of exceedance, PE,
locations shaken more frequently, will have larger ground
motions.

For a LARGE exceedance probability, the map will show the
relatively likely ground motions, which are LOW ground motions,
because small magnitude earthquakes are much more likely to
occur than are large magnitude earthquakes. For a SMALL
exceedance probability, the map will emphasize the effect of
less likely events: larger-magnitude and/or closer-distance
events, producing overall LARGE ground motions on the map.

The maps have this format, because they are designed to be
useful in building codes, in which we assume that, for the most
part, all buildings would be built to the same level of
safety. For other applications, maps of another format might be
more useful.

For instance, many buildings across the US are built more or
less the same, regardless of earthquake hazard. If we knew that
a particular type of building was likely to fail at a particular
ground motion level, we could make a map showing contours of the
likelihood of that ground motion value being exceeded, due to
earthquakes.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Continental Margins</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An integrated effort to document and explain biodiversity patterns on gradient-dominated continental margins, including the potential interactions among their variety of habitats and ecosystems.

The continental margins are the ribbons of seafloor beginning at the edge of the continental slope and extending rapidly to abyssal plain depths. During the past few decades, our understanding of deep continental margin habitats has changed more than for any other large area of Earth. While it has been known for a long time that the ocean margins are a mixture of rugged mountainous scenery and sediment- covered slopes, it is only in recent times, with higher-resolution bathymetry and increased bottom sampling, that areas once envisioned as monotonous landscapes are now acknowledged to have a high degree of complexity and diversity. Continental margins furthermore support some of the ocean's strongest gradients (e.g. depth, pressure, organic matter flux, oxygen). Collectively, these processes create unique ecosystems, which some are only now being discovered and which we are just beginning to understand. As exploitation of living and mineral resources is advancing faster than ecological knowledge on continental slopes, a comprehensive analysis of species distribution, biodiversity patterns and processes on continental margins is needed. 

An objective of COMARGE is to turn basic advances in ecology into sound environmental advice. Fundamental patterns of species distribution first observed and explained in the context of monotonous slopes will be re-evaluated in light of the newly recognized heterogeneity of continental margins. Multi-scale habitat definition and mapping will provide basic georeferenced information to develop environmental sensitivity maps. Comprehensive cross-margin syntheses at the species level will enlighten benthic species distributions in the deep-sea realm and refine estimates of how many species co-exist on continental margins. The scale of species distribution is a matter of debate among deep-sea ecologists and a basic requirement in conservation policies. Comprehensive cross-margin syntheses at the community level will allow local to global testing of controls on species diversity, will generate data inputs for food web models and will provide insights in theoretical ecology. A better understanding of biodiversity patterns and processes, ecosystem functioning and their inter-relationships is acutely needed in order to forecast environmental risks on continental margins.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An international exploratory study of the macrofauna of the northern mid-Atlantic Ocean including the processes that control their distribution and community structures in the waters around the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

The MAR-ECO Project is part of a ten-year global programme to explore the world's oceans entitled, the Census of Marine Life. MAR-ECO aims to describe and understand the patterns of distribution, abundance and the trophic relationships among the organisms inhabiting the waters over and around the mid-Atlantic Ridge. It also aims to identify and model the ecological processes that cause variability in these patterns. The project will chiefly focus on fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and gelatinous plankton and other actively swimming organisms, but there will also be some focus on top predators such as seabirds and cetaceans, which interact with the more surface environment.

The project also aims to share the results of the research exploration with the general public and has begun public outreach initiatives including a web site, school project, ship-to-shore communication, documentary film, video shorts, exhibition ideas and a book project. A well-known Norwegian artist has expressed interest in participating in the project, which gives it a unique interdisciplinary art/science dimension.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) high-resolution sea
surface temperature pilot project (GHRSST-PP) has been established to give
international focus and coordination to the development of a new generation of
global, multi-sensor, high-resolution (~6 hours and 10 km), SST products.

The GHRSST-PP primary project aim is to: "Ensure the provision of rapidly and
regularly diffused, high-quality sea surface temperature products at a fine
spatial and temporal resolution that meet the diverse needs of GODAE, the
scientific community, operational users and climate applications at a global
scale."

The GHRSST-PP brings together international Space Agencies, Research
Institutes, Universities, operational ocean forecasting agencies (civil and
military) and Government agencies to collectively solve the scientific,
logistical and managerial challenges posed by creating the SST data products
and services within the GHRSST-PP.

NOAA NODC maintains the long term archive and works collaboratively with the
NASA JPL/Caltech Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center
(PO.DAAC) to provide key stewardship of these valuable data sets. NODC also
leads the reanalysis component of GHRSST-PP, which will periodically reprocess
the GHRSST record to produce more accurate and consistent Level 4 (gap free,
gridded) SST analysis products for the global ocean.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">The U.S. Max '91 Program of Flare Research Campaigns</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

Scientific Objective and Current Program Status:
     The scientific objective of Max '91 is to investigate the fundamental
unsolved problems of flare physics including the processes of energy
storage, release, and transport, and particle acceleration.  To address
these central scientific issues, the Max '91 observing program utilizes
advanced instrumentation on spacecraft, rockets, and balloons, and at
ground-based observatories.  It  covers the electromagnetic spectrum from
radio through optical to X-rays and gamma-rays, and includes measurements of
neutrons and charged particles in interplanetary space.  Max '91 is designed
to make major advances in solar flare physics through observations of high
energy flare phenomena and of the magnetic and thermal context in which they
take place. This will be achieved using recent advances in instrumentation
technology that now make it possible, for the first time, to observe several
of the most important processes on their intrinsic spatial, spectral and
temporal scales.
     The core space missions for Max '91 will be the Japanese Yohkoh
spacecraft, the Gamma Ray Observatory, and the spacecraft of the Global
Geospace Studies program, particularly WIND and CLUSTER. Instruments on
rockets will provide high-resolution images and spectra in the UV, EUV, and
soft X-rays during the preflare and thermal phases.
     In addition to these space observations, NASA has a program of flights
of advanced hard X-ray and gamma-ray instrumentation capable of making many
types of observations not possible from these spacecraft or rockets. The
NASA Max '91 Solar Balloon Program consisted of long-duration balloon
flights in the Antarctic.  The Berkeley Hard X-Ray and Gammay Ray
Spectrometer with Robert Lin as Primary Investigator obtained balloon data
during the December 1990 campaign.
     Since MAX'91 is part of the FLARES 22 international campaign, many
ground-based observatories around the world has participated in monitoring
the Sun during the MAX-91 campaign periods.
Project Description:
    Max '91 is a program of flare research to observe the sun during the
1991 solar maximum in several campaigns from instruments around the world
and in space.  The following observing campaigns have been successfully
completed:
  SMM, VLA, and Collaborative Observations
    1990, June 16 - July 2
  Energetic Solar Phenomena  1990
    1990, December 20 - 1991, January 13
  Target-of-Opportunity Campaign to Observe Active Region 6659
    1991, June 6-17
  Gamma-Ray, Hard X-Ray, and Neutron Studies of Solar Flares
    1991, October 3-17
  Multiwavelength/Multispacecraft Observations of Solar Flares
    1992, January 6-24
Workshops have been held discussing campaign results, and their proceedings
are available from the program office on request.
     The campaigns have been in a spirit of collaboration by scientists from
all continents and featured the coordinated use of ground based telescopes
in various spectral bands, and instruments on various spacecraft. The data
are held by the individual investigators. The Max '91 campaign distributes
brief descriptions of the participating instruments, coverage, and the names
and addresses of the investigators to contact.
     The Max '91 program office organizes the campaigns and subsequent
meetings, provides support in the form of exchange of campaign information
before, during and after the campaign, and fosters development of new
instrumentation.  After the campaign phase, which lasts from 1991-1994, a
three to four year phase of data analyses and interpretation will be part of
the Max '91 program.  The Max '91 Program is an integral part of the
international FLARES 22 program so that the maximum scientific return can be
obtained with the limited available resources.  Information is distributed
via electronic mail, electronic file transfers on SPAN and INTERNET, IUWDS
Ursigram - GEOALERTS, electronic bulletin board service, TELEX and FAX.
During the campaign daily Campaign Action notices are directly transmitted
to the participants.  In addition, Max '91 workshops are held yearly.
     Several specific research programs are sponsored in the USA by NSF and
NASA in the framework of this campaign.  The campaign coordinator will
supply further information on obtaining on-line information.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Wisconsin Snow and Cloud Experiment - Terra 2000</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Wisconsin Snow and Cloud - Terra 2000 (WISC-T2000) experiment is
being conducted from February 25 to March 13, 2000 to validate science
products from instruments on NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra
satellite. The recently launched (Dec. 1999) Terra satellite is the
first of two (the second, called Aqua, is scheduled for launch in
Dec. 2000) EOS satellites designed to measure earth surface and
atmospheric characteristics over the global domain. Expected science
products include global cloud cover and cloud type, atmospheric
temperature and moisture, surface reflectance, and sea surface
temperature among many others. These measurements will lead to further
understanding of the earth's radiation budget and global climate
change. WISC-T2000 focuses on two of the five Terra instruments, the
MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the
Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). During the experiment a
NASA ER-2 aircraft will be based in Madison, WI and will carry
carefully calibrated instrumentation designed to simulate MODIS and
MISR measurements from Terra. The ER-2 will be used to map surface and
atmospheric properties while Terra is overhead. The ER-2
instrumentation includes the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS), the
Scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (S-HIS), the Cloud
Lidar System (CLS), the Air Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer
(AirMISR), and two camera systems. The MAS data will provide 50 m
resolution images of the earth in solar and thermal bands for mapping
high resolution spatial variation. The S-HIS will be used to measure
the vertical atmospheric profile, producing soundings much like
weather balloons. CLS will be used to map the vertical profile of
clouds and aerosols beneath the ER-2. AirMISR will make multi-angle
measurements of earth reflectance to assess the angular distribution
of solar reflection.

There are several primary objectives of WISC-T2000:

1.To validate cloud detection, cloud height, and cloud particle
characteristics measured by MODIS on Terra, the ER-2 will fly under
MODIS while single layer ice and water clouds are in the scene. These
flights will take place over the DOE ARM CART site in Oklahoma where
many ground-based instruments will also be making cloud measurements.

2.To validate snow detection by MODIS, the ER-2 will fly over snow
fields in the Upper Midwest with measurement teams on the ground. MAS
data will be used to map the spatial variability of the snow fields
for comparison to MODIS.

3.To validate the multi-angle reflectance characteristics of snow
fields, the AirMISR instrument will measure snow surfaces on frozen
Upper Midwest lakes at the same viewing angles as those of MISR.

4.To validate clear atmospheric temperature and moisture structure,
MAS and S-HIS measurements over the DOE ARM CART site will be compared
to those from MODIS.

5.To validate the radiometric calibration of MODIS, MAS and S-HIS
radiance measurements will be compared directly to those of
MODIS. This important fuResults of the above objectives will be used
to adjust and refine the MODIS and MISR global products leading to a
more accurate assessment of the earth's current climate status and
changes that occur over the 10 year combined lifetime of the Terra and
ensuing Aqua missions.


WISC-T2000, the first in a series of Terra science product validation
experiments, is a combined effort of NASA's Dryden Flight Research
Center (DFRC), the University of Wisconsin's Space Science and
Engineering Center (SSEC), NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the
University of Colorado and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center
(GSFC). The ER-2 instrumentation has been developed and maintained at
SSEC, JPL, GSFC, and NASA's Ames Research Center.

Data management support for the program is discussed in the ACE-1 Data Management Plan, September 1995 and operational support details are provided in the ACE-1 Operations Plan, September 1995. operations center Objectives: The specific goal of ACE-1 is to determine and understand the properties and controlling factors of the aerosol in the remote marine environment that are relevant to radiative forcing and climate. To achieve this goal, the ACE-1 Science Team has defined three specific objectives: 1) Document the chemical, physical and radiative characteristics of remote marine aerosols and investigate the relationships between these aerosol properties; 2) Determine the key physical and chemical processes controlling the formation and fate of aerosols and how these processes affect the number size distribution, the chemical composition, and the radiative and cloud nucleating properties of the particles; 3) Assess the climatic importance of remote marine aerosols.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) is an international
programme coordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission (IOC) for the establishment of high quality global and
regional sea level networks for application to climate, oceanographic
and coastal sea level research. The programme became known as GLOSS as
it provides data for deriving the 'Global Level of the Sea Surface'.

The main component of GLOSS is the 'Global Core Network' (GCN) of 287
sea level stations around the world for long term climate change and
oceanographic sea level monitoring.

The Core Network is designed to provide an approximately
evenly-distributed sampling of global coastal sea level
variations. Another component is the GLOSS Long Term Trends (LTT) set
of gauge sites (some, but not all, of which are in the GCN) for
monitoring long term trends and accelerations in global sea
level. These will be priority sites for Global Positioning System
(GPS) receiver installations to monitor vertical land movements, and
their data will contribute to long term climate change studies such as
those of the WMO-UNEP Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC).

The GLOSS altimeter calibration (ALT) set consists mostly of island
stations, and will provide an ongoing facility for mission
intercalibrations. A GLOSS ocean circulation (OC) set, including in
particular gauge pairs at straits and in polar area, complements
altimetric coverage of the open deep ocean within programmes such as
WOCE and CLIVAR.

GLOSS can be considered a component of IOC's Global Ocean Observing
System (GOOS), and particularly as a major contributor to its Climate
and Coastal Modules. Information on the links between GLOSS and other
IOC activities can be obtained from IOC's own web pages.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Project Origination
To accomplish the objectives of CASERTZ, we partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey to develop a Twin Otter aerogeophysical platform that succeeded in integrating, ice-penetrating radar, laser altimetry, gravity and magnetic instrumentation for simultaneous operation. In 1994, in response to the science proposal to complete the CASERTZ corridors, the National Science Foundation&amp;#039;s Office of Polar Programs requested that the aircraft and its integrated instrumentation package be operated as a facility with a mission of providing aerogeophysical observations to the broader Antarctic science community. This request led to a Cooperative Agreement between UTIG and NSF that created the Support Office for Aerogeophysical Research (SOAR).
The SOAR Mission
The six-year Cooperative Agreement defined UTIG&amp;#039;s responsibilities as:


-Assisting in the development of aerogeophysical research projects with NSF/OPP investigators

-Upgrading the CASERTZ instrumentation package to accommodate new science projects and advances in technology;  fielding this instrument package to accomplish SOAR developed projects

-Distribution of the acquired aerogeophysical data as spatially organized transects to the Project Investigators within six months of its return from the field.

An option was included for SOAR to reduce and analyze the aerogeophysical data that it collected for members of the scientific community without that capacity.

SOAR Accomplishments
Beginning in 1994, UTIG conducted aerogeophysical surveys in seven consecutive Antarctic field seasons. These SOAR-developed surveys were performed for the 20 investigators and 14 institutions listed in Table 1. The first six of these seasons were managed under the NSF/UTIG Cooperative Agreement with D. Blankenship as PI; the last, 2000/2001, was managed as a multi-investigator grant to UTIG with D. Blankenship, J. Holt, D. Morse and I. Dalziel as co PI&amp;#039;s. To accomplish these surveys, UTIG configured the integrated instrumentation package and installed it in the aircraft on site in Antarctica each season; additionally, base camp operations were established at up to five remote sites each field season. In total, UTIG conducted an additional 225,000 line kilometers of aerogeophysical surveys in 422 flights covering the areas shown in the Figure. The spatially organized database of geophysical transects was delivered to the various investigators within the targeted six-month time frame.

The Solar Terrestrial Probes (STP) Program is part of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate Heliophysics Division. The Program addresses fundamental science questions about the physics of space plasmas and the flow of mass and energy through the solar system. STP program objectives are to:

- Understand the fundamental physical processes of the space environment from the Sun to Earth, to other planets, and beyond to the interstellar medium.
- Understand how human society, technological systems, and the habitability of planets are affected by solar variability and planetary magnetic fields
- Develop the capability to predict the extreme and dynamic conditions in space in order to maximize the safety and productivity of human and robotic explorers.

These objectives support the Agency’s strategic goal to understand the Sun and its effects on Earth and the solar system. The Earth and Sun are linked together to form the system that has given origin and sustenance to our lives. STP missions will study the Earth and Sun system for insights into questions concerning how the system evolved so as to produce and sustain life, what will happen to this unique environment through the course of time, and how it will affect us.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Sensor Intercomparison Merger for Biological Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for Biological and
Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) program was conceived in
1994 as a result of a NASA management review of the agency's strategy
for monitoring the bio-optical properties of the global ocean through
ocean color remote sensing from space.
The initial SIMBIOS program is scoped for five years (1997-2001) and
includes support for the science team  (NASA Research Announcement
(NRA) selections) and the project office. In 1995, the International
Ocean Colour-Coordinating Group (IOCCG) was formed to undertake the
organization of an international SIMBIOS program. The IOCCG presently
operates under the auspices of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic
Research (SCOR) and chairmanship of Dr. Trevor Platt.

The NASA program consists of the SIMBIOS Science Team and the SIMBIOS
Project Office. The SIMBIOS Science Team, as initially defined by the
NRA selections, was expanded to include additional investigations for
atmospheric correction algorithm validation. The SIMBIOS program is
substantially augmented by the participation of the NASA-supported
MODIS Oceans Team and SeaWiFS Calibration and Validation program.

SIMBIOS collaborators associated with other relevant programs and
science teams who contribute data, algorithms, etc., are given access
to SIMBIOS Project resources in return, e.g., access to the SeaWiFS
Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS). Besides providing
administrative and contract support for the science team, the SIMBIOS
Project Office is scoped to support four primary activities: data
product validation, sensor calibration, data merger algorithm
evaluation, and satellite data processing.

The SIMBIOS Project has created a pool of ocean bio-optical
instruments, the use of which will be shared between NASA-supported,
U.S. investigators contributing to the SIMBIOS program. This
"Instrument Pool" is an attempt to provide a cost-effective
enhancement to the overall capabilities of the SIMBIOS Science Team,
and to provide backup in case of failure of a critical instrument
during an experiment. The equipment in the Instrument Pool are
purchased and maintained by individual SIMBIOS principal
investigators, but deployment schedules and priorities are coordinated
by the Project Office with the advice of the Science Team. To better
support validation of algorithms for atmospheric corrections and
aerosol property retrievals, the SIMBIOS Project Office has
established a close working collaboration with the Aerosol Network
(AERONET) project, which maintains and operates a worldwide network of
sun-tracking photometers. The NASA AERONET program is managed GSFC
personnel. The Project Office has purchased equipment for nine
additional island and coastal sun-photometer stations to be added to
the AERONET, and has linked the AERONET archives to SeaBASS. In
addition, the Project Office maintains a pool of hand-held sun
photometers, which are calibrated by the GSFC AERONET investigators
and are made available to SIMBIOS investigators during field
experiments

During the 1980s, the National Weather Service (NWS) embarked on a
major modernization program. As a key part of this effort, NWS
management emphasized strengthening the professional preparation and
current qualifications of operational meteorologists to apply
mesoscale data effectively. A second goal was to accelerate the
incorporation of research findings into operational practices.

At the request of the NWS, the UCAR Board of Trustees established the
Cooperative Program for Operational Meteorology, Education and
Training (COMET) in 1989. The COMET Program was originally envisioned
as a broad effort to affect meteorology education and training in the
United States. However, the program has recently been involved in
activities to enhance meteorology education in universities and
meteorological services throughout the world. The COMET program
director is Dr. Timothy Spangler.

To meet the objective of improving mesoscale forecasting in the United
States, an Outreach Program was developed at the COMET Program. This
program currently provides financial support to universities for
collaborative research projects, graduate student fellowships,
postdoctoral fellowships, and other activities.

The results of this study together with knowledge about the chemistry of oceanic CO{sub 2} can be used to help understand oceanic uptake of fossil fuel CO{sub 2}. The experiment lasted 4 years and consisted of the following parts: (1) (1981); (3) laboratory analysis (1982); and (4) completion, data analysis, and reporting (1983). Shipboard measurements were published by the Scripps Physical and Chemical Oceanographic Data Facility as the T.T.O. Preliminary Hydrographic Data Reports Vols. I-IV. Recently, revisions to some of the previously reported measurements have been made and estimates of total CO{sub 2} have been calculated.

To validate these products, BigFoot combined ground measurements, high-resolution remote-sensing data, and ecosystem process models at nine flux tower sites representing different biomes to evaluate the effects of the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem characteristics on MODIS products.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">"GPS Meteorology" is a name given to the body of science and technology which makes use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for active remote sensing of the Earth atmosphere. At the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), scientists have already demonstrated one GPS Meteorology technique using ground based GPS receivers.[1] "Ground based GPS Meteorology is capable of accurate, continuous, integrated precipitable water vapor measurements at fixed sites. In the near future, a UCAR lead team intends to demonstrate an active limb sounding technique using radio occultation observations taken by an orbiting GPS receiver. We refer to this program and the technology under development collectively as "GPS/MET".
      
The primary GPS/MET Program objectives are:
(1) to construct a system and use it to collect GPS occultation data,
      
(2) to develop and demonstrate algorithms for the recovery of accurate refractivity profiles and derivative products, such as pressure, temperature and moisture profiles, (3) to evaluate the net impact of GPS/MET occultation data on weather forecasts and global change research, and (4) to publish GPS/MET data in forms useful to other scientists investigating meteorological and related applications.
      
Note that GPS/MET promises to produce high quality data for two of the key global change variables identified by the Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences: atmospheric temperature and moisture distribution. Moreover, the goals for GPS/MET address specific objectives identified in NOAA's 1992 Strategic Plan for Upper- Air Observations. If successful, this proof- of- concept demonstration could pave the way for a new, low cost operational sounding system capable of thousands of globally distributed soundings per day.
      
To achieve these objectives quickly and inexpensively, a modified commercial GPS receiver will be flown on a host satellite as a secondary payload. Launch of this satellite, the MicroLab-1, is scheduled for Fall, 1994. GPS occultation data, ancillary data taken from ground based observations, and derived information products will be published on the Internet beginning early 1995. To establish the predicted performance of the system, the GPS/MET team is conducting various tests and a detailed error analysis on the end- to- end system. Gridded data derived from operational observing systems will be used to validate GPS/MET data. Four Dimensional Data Assimilation (4DDA) software tools are under development for use in the assessment of the technique's net impact on weather forecasts.
      
The GPS/MET Program is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additional support is being provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and two industrial corporations: Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) and Allen Osborne Associates, Inc. (AOA). The GPS/MET team includes researchers from UCAR's UNAVCO and NCAR/MMM divisions, and from the University of Arizona (U of AZ) and CalTech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An experiment called Variability of Coastal Atmospheric Refractivity (VOCAR) was designed under a larger program called Coastal Variability Analysis, Measurements, and Prediction. VOCAR is a multi-year experimental effort to investigate the variability of atmospheric refractivity with emphasis on the coastal zone. The experiment is being conducted by the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center RDT&amp;E Division jointly with the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, the Naval Research Laboratory (Washington, DC and Monterey), and the Naval Postgraduate School. In addition, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Environmental Technology Laboratory, Penn State University Applied Research Laboratory and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory participated in the intensive measurement phase of VOCAR. The objectives of VOCAR are to provide an assessment capability for horizontally varying refractivity conditions in a coastal environment and to develop a remote sensing capability. The propagation measurements being made during VOCAR consist of monitoring signal strength variations of VHF/UHF transmitters in the southern California coastal region. Corresponding meteorological measurements are made during routine, special, and intensive observation periods.

variability impacts on river flow at the catchment scale.
Six projects were funded involving groups from the Institute of
Hydrology, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the universities of
London (Imperial College and University College), Newcastle, Reading
(including the Joint Centre for Mesoscale Meteorology or JCMM) and
Salford. Theprojects ranged from research on improved precipitation
measurement using polarisation and vertical pointing radars, through
network design of radar/raingauge networks and spatial-temporal
modelling of rainfall fields, to rainfall orecasting based on
stochastic and meteorological concepts. An overview of the six HYREX

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: POLAR: WMT
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=45

Due to distances, extreme climate, and lack of present day infrastructure, the North is critically lacking in education and training opportunities. With modern technology, incorporating advances in communications and computers, these barriers can be overcome resulting in a transforming impact in polar communities. As a global leader in online distance education (e-learning), Athabasca University Canada's Open University (AU) with its partners in the University of the Arctic and allied institutions in other countries, is the natural choice to implement viable learning programs. For example, AU's exemplary programs in Health sciences, nursing, education, policing, computer and information systems, and management, address subject areas in which there is a critical lack of skilled personnel in the North, and in particular among the indigenous communities. By combining this internationally recognized educational leadership in e-learning, which is eminently appropriate for reaching the North, with the exploration of new and appropriate technologies including satellite and mobile media, many of the major obstacles to learning in the Arctic can be overcome.

Growing from AU's experience working with information and communication technologies for learning and from its international partnerships, the participants in this project propose to develop an advanced learning network using Internet via satellite access technologies to reach remote communities and wireless devices for dissemination and communications within the communities. This high tech delivery will be used to support a learning-centred methodological approach to learning, teaching, and community development. This will promote an online learning culture in rural communities improving digital literacy, access to local and external educational resources, promoting lifelong community-centred learning and collaboration, while reducing technology resistance in dozens of pilot sites in up to eight Arctic countries using the partnerships developed through AU's membership in the University of the Arctic. The ultimate goals are growth, and the transfer of knowledge at various levels, in a range of relevant subject areas, starting with a specific, particularly appropriate module in e-portfolio development for prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR) and a first year university course in polar astronomy/space science, taking advantage of the internet accessible astronomical observatory at Athabasca University. A range of full programmes for polar students is envisioned. This POLAR WMT learning network can also be accessed by other scientists for the training of high quality personnel using high speed electronic media to deliver courses and conduct lessons, workshops, seminars, and lectures. A principal aim of this project is to support the creation of a new culture in rural communities promoting digital literacy and reducing resistance to the use of new technologies. It will go a step further, encouraging user to add their significant contribution to the emerging applications by involving them in meaningful activities, tailored to address the needs of different user groups. Thus, this project aims to offer stimulating and creative learning environments to support vibrant user communities and will attempt an extended implementation in dozens of pilot sites in the Arctic 

This project will be based on innovative "action" and "design-based" research methodologies and practices aimed at experimenting with and developing real world implementations of new learning experiences for remote learners using the latest technologies. The objective is to facilitate learning in homes, schools, the workplace, community centres, adult education forums, and a variety of informal contexts using wireless and mobile devices. Serving the special needs of learners in the Arctic requires a better understanding of the geographical, cultural and evolving technological environment in which they live.

The project will mobilize community support by involving stake holders (community leaders, government officials, local teachers) in the creation of a plan for the sustainability and development of the learning system exploring new technologies as they arise and their applicability for learning. This will involve (1) determining how the satellite/wireless platform will need to evolve in order to meet increasing user expectations (2) comparing this with current developments that are under way with the ICT hardware and software development companies (3) developing innovative ways of implementing the satellite/wireless infrastructure, demonstrating the enhanced potential of communication via satellite to the users in the Arctic region (4) selecting the most appropriate applications, and proposing a roadmap for replication, including both technical and pedagogical demonstrations promoting the use of satellite/wireless learning widely throughout the Arctic.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SOLAS (Surface Ocean - Lower Atmosphere Study) is an international research initiative that has as its goal:

To achieve quantitative understanding of the key biogeochemical-physical interactions and feedbacks between the ocean and atmosphere, and of how this coupled system affects and is affected by climate and environmental change.

SOLAS research covers all ocean areas including coastal seas and ice-covered regions.  One fundamental characteristic of SOLAS is that the research is interdisciplinary in that it involves biology, geochemistry, physics, and mathematical modelling.  It also involves another layer of interdependence because  each of these disciplines has a marine side and an atmospheric side.  The two sides of each discipline need to work together so that SOLAS research can be meaningful and successful.  This multi-layered dependence will require a paradigm shift in the arenas of academia and funding, which is more likely to separate disciplines than to combine them.

SOLAS has three scientific foci:

Focus 1: Biogeochemical interactions and feedbacks between ocean and atmosphere

The objective of Focus 1 is to quantify feedback mechanisms involving biogeochemical coupling across the air-sea interface, which can only be achieved by studying the ocean and atmosphere in concert.  These couplings include emissions of trace gases and particles and their reactions of importance in atmospheric chemistry and climate, and deposition of nutrients that control marine biological activity and carbon uptake.

Focus 2: Exchange processes at the air-sea interface and the role of transport and transformation in the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers

The objective of Focus 2 is to develop a quantitative understanding of processes responsible for air-sea exchange of mass, momentum and energy to permit accurate calculation of regional and global fluxes.  This requires establishing the dependence of these facial transfer mechanisms on physical, biological and chemical factors within the boundary layers, and the horizontal and vertical transport and transformation processes that regulate these exchanges.

Focus 3: Air-sea flux of carbon dioxide and other long-lived radiatively active gases

The air-sea carbon dioxide flux is a key inter-reservoir exchange within the global carbon cycle.  The oceans also play an important role in the global budgets of other long-lived radiatively active gases, including nitrous oxide and to some extent methane.  The objective of Focus 3 is to characterise the air-sea flux of these gases and the boundary layer mechanisms that drive them, in order to assess their sensitivity to variations in environmental forcing.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">RONNE POLYNYA EXPERIMENT</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">[from ROPEX Background page,
"http://www.esr.org/ropex/ronice.html#bac"]

The Ronne Polynya Experiment (ROPEX) was carried out in the southern
Weddell Sea in January and February 1998, using the Royal Navy
ice-strengthened hydrographic vessel HMS Endurance. The experiment
focused on the southern shelf of the Weddell Sea.

The ship departed from the Falkland Islands on January 14 and returned
on February 20, operating in the southern Weddell Sea for the period
January 21 to February 12. Over one hundred
conductivity-temperature-depth ("CTD") stations were collected in the
region of the Filchner overflow, and near and north of the Ronne ice
front. Bathymetry data were obtained over the southwestern continental
shelf, a region for which no prior data existed. Five European current
meter moorings were recovered, three from the Ronne ice front and two
from the Filchner Depression. Four new European/US moorings were
deployed in a region where dense water modified by the inclusion of
potentially supercooled Ice Shelf Water first flows down the
continental slope after leaving the Filchner Depression.

The primary goal of the program was to obtain oceanographic, sea-ice,
and atmospheric measurements to improve our understanding of the
physical processes coupling the southern Weddell Sea to the
circulation and properties of the global ocean and atmosphere. In the
southern Weddell Sea, four elements strongly interact with each other:
the ocean over the continental shelf; the polar atmosphere; sea-ice
(when it is present); and the massive floating glacial ice shelves,
which are the oceanic termination of continental ice as it flows off
the Antarctic continent.

Therefore, the primary research tasks for the cruise were:
  - Atmospheric measurements over sea ice and boundary layer
development near ice shelves;
  - Sea ice observations and sampling;
  - Conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) ocean profiling;
  - Oceanographic mooring deployment and recovery; and
Bathymetry.

Sea ice conditions during the cruise were very favourable, allowing
the ship to survey a large area north of the Ronne Ice Front.  No
previous oceanographic or even bathymetric data have been obtained
from this region.

Our data will be integrated with other programs in the region,
including measurements obtained under the Ronne Ice Shelf (Nicholls,
1996). This study will improve our ability to model the Weddell Sea's
role in such processes as the global fresh water budget and the
generation of Antarctic Bottom Water, the latter being a fundamental
component of the Global Ocean Conveyor Belt (Broecker, 1991).

The primary institution responsible for the ROPEX cruise is the
British Antarctic Survey (BAS). Other participating institutions are:

  - Southampton Oceanography Center (Southampton, UK);
  - Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (Liverpool, UK);
  - Alfred-Wegener Institute (Bremerhaven, Germany);
  - Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (Hanover, New
Hampshire);
  - Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, New Mexico); and
  - Earth &amp; Space Research (Seattle, Washington).

The US component of this research was supported by the National
Science Foundation grant OPP-9615525.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=35

GEOTRACES is an international study of the global marine biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and their isotopes. Its mission is:

To identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions.

The GEOTRACES mission can be expressed as three overriding goals:

    " To determine full water column distributions of selected trace elements and isotopes, including their concentration, chemical speciation, and physical form, along a sufficient number of sections in each ocean basin to establish the principal relationships between these distributions and with more traditional hydrographic parameters;

    " To evaluate the sources, sinks, and internal cycling of these species and thereby characterize more completely the physical, chemical and biological processes regulating their distributions, and the sensitivity of these processes to global change; and

    " To understand the processes that control the concentrations of geochemical species used for proxies of the past environment, both in the water column and in the substrates that reflect the water column.

GEOTRACES will be global in scope, consisting of ocean sections complemented by regional process studies.   Sections and process studies will combine fieldwork, laboratory experiments and modelling.   Beyond realizing the scientific objectives identified above, a natural outcome of this work will be to build a community of marine scientists who understand the processes regulating trace element cycles sufficiently well to exploit this knowledge reliably in future interdisciplinary studies.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Antarctica is the primary heat sink in the global climate system, and plays an important role in climate change and variability. Projections of the state of global change (e.g., global warming, ozone depletion) must accurately account for Antarctic atmospheric processes whose effects are transmitted to the rest of the planet via the atmosphere and the ocean. In addition, the processes by which tropical latitudes impact Antarctic are not well understood.

As a means to improve our understanding of atmospheric processes and transports between Antarctica and lower latitudes, a basic and applied research program is proposed to explore these atmospheric processes in detail. AC Squared will consist of both observational and modeling components with the fundamental goals to study the physical processes associated with transports throughout atmospheric column from the near-surface layer to the lower stratosphere and examine modulation of those transports during episodes of extratropical cyclone forcing, to accurately simulate these processes within numerical models, and to understand the mechanisms that produce teleconnections from the tropics and Antarctica, especially the interaction between the Southern Annular Mode and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. As an additional benefit, AC Squared will advance short term to medium range weather forecasting in the high southern latitudes. It is believed that proper representation of Antarctic processes is prerequisite to accurate climate studies, especially since Antarctic transports are strongly tied to local topographic and mesoscale processes that are currently not resolved within GCMs. It is therefore necessary to understand local and regional processes before these effects can be assimilated into GCMs and global change issues can be considered. A series of objectives have been set for AC Squared that are deemed necessary before climate sensitivity issues can be addressed:

• Objective 1: To better understand key phenomena such as boundary-layer dynamics, topographic modification of synoptic and mesoscale features, cloud-radiation interactions, and moist processes accompanying episodes of cyclonic activity over the Southern Ocean adjacent to Antarctica that are associated with interactions between Antarctica and lower latitudes.
• Objective 2: To examine key processes associated with the dynamics and chemistry of the lower stratosphere including development of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), conduct field observations and in-situ measurements of chemical species and transports and modulation by large-scale dynamics processes.
• Objective 3: To conduct detailed measurements of key physical processes in the boundary layer and free atmosphere to permit the development of accurate parameterization schemes for use within numerical models, leading to high quality simulations of the atmospheric interactions.
• Objective 4: To investigate the nature of atmospheric teleconnections and their modulation of the atmospheric interactions between Antarctica and lower latitudes using numerical models, atmospheric reanalyses, and satellite observations

Objectives 1 and 2 will rely primarily on observations from the state-of-the-art HIAPER research aircraft flown out of Punta Arenas, Chile and southern New Zealand. Studies will be concentrated over the Weddell and Ross Sea embayments and areas to the north in association with the Schwerdtfeger Air Stream (SAS) and the Ross Air Stream (RAS), respectively. Satellite observations show PSCs to form frequently in the Weddell Sea area and airborne measurements will be conducted in the lower stratosphere in support of studies of transport dynamics of key chemical species.

Objective 3 will rely on a combination of airborne and ground-based measurements that will likely be concentrated in the Ross Sea vicinity. Attempts are being made to use fixed wing research aircraft such as the British Twin Otter or Twin Otters currently used in support of U.S operations for low-level measurements.

Objective 4 has a strong climate component and objective 1 can be thought of as case studies of the phenomena studied over a much longer period by this objective.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=26

Rationale

The extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice vary considerably from year to year and over decadal time scales. Assessing the processes of oceanic and atmospheric forcing on this ice cover is critically important in understanding the response of the Arctic marine ecosystem to climate variability and change. Security of food sources is a key element in this change as is the stability of traditional lifestyles, sustainable exploitation of new resources and education of the next generation of Arctic Scientists. The present variability in sea ice cover on Arctic marine ecosystems and regional climate requires a substantial improvement in our understanding of the links between freshwater and sea ice, sea ice and climate, and sea ice and biogeochemical fluxes. The need for data is particularly strong for the shallow coastal shelf regions (30% of the Arctic basin), the shelf-basin interface and within the marginal ice zones and polynyas of the Arctic.The environmental, socio-economic and geopolitical consequences of an eventual sustained reduction of Arctic sea ice are bound to be tremendous: marine Arctic ecosystems will be displaced, a new ocean will open to exploitation, climate warming may accelerate, global ocean circulation may be modified, and traditional use will change. Given our Arctic responsibilities the PAN-AME cluster is an essential element in the international efforts to understand the current a near future changes on the physical-biological coupling within the Arctic marine ecosystem.

Science 

The PANA-AME cluster will focus on testable hypotheses integrated across several research projects in a coordinate effort to examine the role of that changing oceanic and atmospheric forcing have over the Arctic marine ecosystem. Space limits the presentation of these but we illustrate with these core questions to be addressed: What is the role of hydrologic, oceanographic and meteorological processes in ice growth, decay and transport in each of the cluster regions of interest (ROI) and what is the large scale context within which they are embedded? What are the hydrodynamic (including ice and snow cover dynamics) control of Arctic shelf photosynthetic production and its export to the benthos and the pelagic food web. What is the flux of carbon associated with these processes and how does this change in our various ROI? What is the potential impact of increased UV radiation on biological productivity? What is the role of microheterotrophs and mesozooplankton in transforming autochthonous and allochthonous particulate and dissolved matter? What are the trophic linagkages in various ROI within our cluster how is energy transfer between trophic levels affected by changes inn the physical system? How are contaminants linked to changes in the physical and biological systems and what is the nature of source, sink and transport these elements? Detailed physical and biological measurements will be used to constrain and calibrate physical models of ocean-sea ice-atmosphere coupling and biophysical models of ecosystem function and carbon flows within the IPY-AME regions of interest. Field work will focus on significant time scales pertinent to each of our ROI with ranges from weekly to interannually. Observatories will be a key element in the cluster with installation within the IPY timeframe and continuation of these observatories as a legacy of the IPY.

Benefits
 
This cluster marshals the majority of existing international expertise in Arctic marine ecosystem research. It also marshals involvement of circumarctic aboriginal peoples through involvement in individual ROIs. By clustering we agree to integrate our geographically separate projects into a coordinated pan-Arctic IPY program through standardization of sampling methods, coordination of people, resources, and access to a wealth of existing arctic logistics (field stations, ice camps, ships, aircraft). We agree to archive a coordinated data repository which will remain as a legacy of this project. We also intend to share data amongst science teams working in different ROIs as a means of assessing marine ecosystem response to pan-arctic climate variability and change.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In the summer of 2004 several separate field programs intensively studied the photochemical, heterogeneous chemical and radiative environment of the troposphere over North America, the North Atlantic Ocean, and western Europe. Previous studies have indicated that the transport of continental emissions, particularly from North America, influences the concentrations of trace species in the troposphere over the North Atlantic and Europe. An international team of scientists, representing over 100 laboratories, collaborated under the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT) umbrella to coordinate the separate field programs in order to maximize the resulting advances in our understanding of regional air quality, the transport, chemical transformation and removal of aerosols, ozone, and their precursors during intercontinental transport, and the radiation balance of the troposphere. Participants utilized nine aircraft, one research vessel, several ground-based sites in North America and the Azores, a network of aerosol-ozone lidars in Europe, satellites, balloon borne sondes, and routine commercial aircraft measurements.

It is focused on knowledge development, the primarily post-computational phase where data moves to information, discovery, and communication. Our program includes research, development, deployment, and state-of-the-art facilities and spans the realms of large-scale data analysis and visualization, web environments and infrastructure, collaborative environments and collaboratories, Grid technology, and education and outreach.

VETS has grown by over 50% in the last year, now has a staff of 18, and will continue to grow in FY2003. This was a year of progress on many fronts. We moved our new Visualization Lab and AccessGrid into a fully operational mode, and its popularity, usage, and impact greatly exceeded our initial high expectations. NCL capabilities were dramatically expanded particularly relative to the new release of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). We made substantial progress in advancing the DOE-sponsored Earth System Grid project, engaged in collaborative work with the Unidata-led THREDDS project, and moved our NSF-funded VGEE project into its final phase. This year we played the lead role in the development of another iteration of the Knowledge Environment for the Geosciences (KEG) proposal to NSF&amp;#039;s ITR program and contributed to quite a number of other proposals as well.

We also began work on NCAR Strategic Initiatives in the area of web-based data provision and next-generation web environments, and through the efforts of the Web Engineering Group (WEG) further expanded our core hardware and software information technology for all of UCAR. VETS staff engaged in a broad portfolio of collaborative interactions with people and projects at NCAR and other organizations. We also continued our tradition of maintaining a high level of visibility at both conferences and via a huge number of internal events. In the pages that follow, we briefly summarize our progress in providing facilities for analysis, visualization, and collaboration.

Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) is a
focused Global Change program sponsored by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) to enhance the capability of ground-based instruments
to measure the upper atmosphere and to coordinate instrument and model
data for the benefit of the scientific community.
The CEDAR Data Base (formerly the Incoherent Scatter Radar Data Base)
is a cooperative project between the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) and several institutions that provide upper atmosphere
data and model output for community use. There are 10 GB of data on
the cedar.hao.ucar.edu computer in the High Altitude Observatory (HAO)
division of NCAR.
The CEDAR Data Base, Data Base Catalog, ftp site, and model output data
are located at the HAO:
"http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu/index.html"
The CEDAR concept originated in the mid-1980's and was developed over
several years through workshops, symposia, and committee deliberations
by nearly 100 scientists involved in aeronomical studies. These
activities led to a comprehensive report that provided a framework for
developing upper atmospheric research in the United States through an
evolutionary strategy of instrument development and deployment
coordinated with campaign activities related to the globalscale,
coupled, nearearth environment. The program has attracted a large
number of graduate students and many international
collaborators. Guidance is provided by a science steering committee
appointed by the NSF Aeronomy and Upper Atmospheric Facilities program
directors; scientific feedback to the community is provided by
newsletters and an annual summer workshop.
Three broad categories embrace the scientific goals of the CEDAR
program: (1) dynamics and energetics of the upper atmosphere, with
particular emphasis on the hard to observe region between 80 and 150
km; (2) coupling between the mesosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere,
exosphere, and magnetosphere; and (3) horizontal coupling between
adjacent geographic regions. CEDAR has provided the community with
improved spectrometers, interferometers, and imagers; allowed upgrades
of existing facilities; and supported the development of lidars and
small radars. Several facilities have been established containing a
broad array of state of the art tools to provide a solid
infrastructure with which to attack outstanding aeronomy problems well
into the future.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Arctic Leads Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Lead Experiment (LeadEx) was a experiment sponsored by the Office of
Naval Research (ONR) to study the crack-like openings called leads
that are created by the deformation of Arctic pack ice. The study was
conducted by a group of scientists from various institutions and
disciplines to clarify the effect of open leads on the polar ocean and
atmosphere and to further understanding of the role of polar regions
on climate and global change.
The LeadEx was conducted during March and April 1992 in the Beaufort
Sea approximately 300 km north of Deadhorse, Alaska.
Leads range from a few meters to thousands of meters wide and have
long been considered important to the thermodynamics of the polar
regions. Leads can account for nearly half of the total heat flux from
the ocean (Badgley, 1966) because the lead exposed relatively warm
water to the cold atmosphere. Leads have a major effect on the
salinity of the ocean mixed layer.
The LeadEx program began in 1990 with funding from the ONR Accelerated
Research Initiative. Initial studies were made at the University of
Arizona and the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of
Washington.
The main experiment began on March 16, 1992 with the establishment of
a base camp that drifted generally westward until the program ended on
April 25, 1992. Weather forecasts and remote sensing data were
provided by the LeadEx weather center at the National Weather Service
(NWS) in Anchorage, Alaska. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) at
Monterey, CA transmitted mesoscale meteorological model forecasts of
wind, temperature, moisture, and cloud height to the LeadEx weather
center twice daily. Near-real-time high-resolution satellite data from
NOAA satellites and DMSP satellites were also made available.
Huts and equipment were deployed from the main base camp to four sites
called Lead 1 - Lead 4. Most of the data were gathered at Lead 3 and 4
since Leads 1 and 2 were closed soon after the sites were occupied.
Helicopter and research aircraft made numerous oceanographic and
meteorological measurements.
Meteorological effects were measured primarily by the Wave Propogation
Laboratory (WPL) in Boulder, CO. WPL instrumentation included sonic
anemometers, pyranometers and pyrgeometers, and 6.5 kHz SODARs.
Rawinsondes were launched by WPL to support atmospheric soundings
conducted by the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, CA. The
NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and NPS deployed
drifting buoys.
Several aircraft programs were conducted using the University of
Washington Convair C-131A and a DeHavilland Twin Otter (DHC-6). The
group measured atmospheric temperature, water vapor concentrations and
biogenic emissions of dimethylsulfide (DMS) from leads. A
high-resolution, down-looking infrared thermometer was used on both
aircraft.
Growth rate of ice in the leads was measured by groups from PSC using
freeze-in buoys. Physical properties of the ice was measured by the
Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL).
Remote sensing applications for ice studies was conducted by the
Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington to
determine microwave and infrared brightness temperatures of thin ice
in the freezing leads and selected first-year ice. Observations were
made at 6.7, 10, 18.7, 37 GHz and 10 microns. A team from the
Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) measured radar
backscatter at multiple frequencies, polarizations, and angles
simultaneously. A group from Williamson and Associates measured
thermally induced stress in the lead ice.
Oceanographic measurements included profiles of conductivity,
temperature, turbulent shear, and acoustic backscatter. The McPhee
Research Company (MRC) used a mast of multiple sensors to obtain time
series of mean velocity, temperature, and salinity and turbulent

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=457


The International Polar Year (IPY 2007-09) gives the public, teachers and students an extraordinary opportunity to experience the process of scientific discovery in action. Ice Stories provides a public face for IPY by using the power of contemporary media to bring current research to mass audiences with unprecedented intimacy and immediacy. 

Ice Stories includes:

-A media-rich, dynamic and continuously updated public Web site 
-A media-assets database for journalists, media producers, educators, and museum partners
-Training program in media production and story-telling for 15 scientist-correspondents a year.

Ice Stories provides the public with access to IPY research through the development of a network of Exploratorium-trained polar field correspondents. It makes use of the design, education and production capacity of an informal science center to create a bridge between scientific discovery and interested members of the public. Ice Stories employs sophisticated media production and communication technology as well as strong partnerships with allied research groups and with scientists and international organizations at the poles. The content of Ice Stories reflects the latest research in many diverse fields and demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of polar research. The Exploratorium has pioneered in translating current science research into exhibits and presentations accessible to museum and Web audiences. It also has long experience creating award-winning Web sites, professional-development workshops, community outreach, and institutional alliances.

Beyond the journalistic presence and educational potential of Ice Stories, its lasting legacy grows from its media-literate scientists, the media they create during IPY, and the training model the project introduces. By training scientists early in their careers, the Exploratorium gives them knowledge and tools to make their research widely accessible and to inspire the public and future generations of scientists. The project also models means of direct communication by scientists to the public and ways science centers and scientists can work together to increase public understanding of science.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Geographic Names Information System</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Background

The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), developed by the
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the U.S. Board
on Geographic Names (BGN), contains information on approximately
2 million physical and cultural geographic features in the
United States. The Federally recognized name of each feature
described in the data base is identified, and references are
made to a feature's location by State, county, and geographic
coordinates. The purpose of the GNIS database development was to
promote geographic feature name standardization and to serve as
the U.S.'s official repository of domestic geographic names
information (see the Introduction section of the Geographic
Names Information System Data Users Guide for more
details). Information on foreign geographic feature names can be
obtained from the GEOnet Names Server, which is developed and
maintained by the National Imagery Mapping Agency (NIMA),
formerly the Defense Mapping Agency.

The GNIS is being compiled in two phases. Phase one is complete
for all States, territories and outlying areas under
U.S. jurisdiction. This phase entailed the collection of feature
names from USGS large-scale topographic maps, U.S. Forest
Service maps, Office of Coast Survey charts, Federal Aviation
Administration files, Federal Communications Commission files,
and files of the Army Corps of Engineers. As of September, 1996,
phase two of the compilation is 45 percent complete and 30
percent in progress for all States, territories, and outlying
areas under U.S. jurisdiction. The second phase captures names
from State, locally and privately published current and
historical maps, charts, and literature. Standard reports and
digital data sets of GNIS geographic name records are available
for each State, territory or outlying area file.

Also available are two thematic extracts of the GNIS
database. The U.S. Populated Places File lists information about
all cities and towns throughout the United States and the
U.S. Concise File lists information about major physical and
cultural features throughout the United States.

Extent of Coverage

The GNIS coverage area includes the United States,
U.S. territories and outlying areas which include: Puerto Rico,
Northern Marianas, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. In
addition, names information for the freely associated areas of
the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall
Islands, and the Republic of Palau, are also included in GNIS
coverage

Data Characteristics

The GNIS contains information about physical and cultural
geographic features identified by a proper name, with the
exception that most roads and highways are not included in
GNIS. The following information about a selected geographic
feature is retrievable by searching the Online GNIS Database.

Federally recognized feature name.  Feature type.  Elevation of
most populated places and summits (i.e., mountain peaks, etc.).
Estimated 1994 population of cities and towns.  State(s) and
county(s) in which the feature is located.  Latitude and
longitude of the feature location.  List of USGS 7.5-minute by
7.5-minute topographic maps on which the feature is shown.
Names other than the federally recognized name by which the
feature may be known.  General instructions, field definitions
and help documentation are included in the GNIS Online Database
to assist usage.  The coordinate extent for the GNIS Online
Database is:

-180.00 west longitude
180.00 east longitude
72.00 north latitude
-12.00 south latitude

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: Observations of PMCs and aurora from ISS
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=78

We propose to coordinate the synchronized observations of Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC) and aurora between the International Space Station (ISS), ground sites, and satellites. We also propose to coordinate observations from other International Polar Year (IPY) activities that might benefit from ISS observations. 
The orbit of the ISS takes it to north and south latitudes of 51.6 degrees at altitudes of 400 km. This provides a human operated platform from which to observe artic and Antarctic phenomena on a length scale of half a continent. This compliments ground site observations and satellite data that can be synchronized in both space and time to record seasonal variations. Observations from the ISS offers an above the cloud vantage including wide angle oblique views, sun-glint textures, day-night terminator lighting, and perhaps most important, human guided observations that can fall outside the purview of pre-programmed field of view instrumentation. The ISS offers a unique platform for Antarctic atmospheric observations since it gives repeated coverage circumscribing the continent every few days where cloud cover the general lack of observation sites limits routine ground observations over long periods of time.
 
We propose to use the current observational equipment on ISS including a suite of digital still cameras, standard video cameras, and a medium resolution, fiber optic coupled visible region spectrograph. We are planning the fabrication for use on ISS of an IMAX-sized format, CCD camera optimised for low light level video if funding permits. With the NASA presidential directive for human exploration beyond Earth orbit, NASA is considering astronaut training in polar regions as analogues for human planetary missions. We propose to coordinate these polar analogue activities with ISS observations. 

Participation in this proposal will be open to all international partners to ISS as well as any other project that wishes to coordinate observations with ISS. All ISS collected data will be archived and publicly distributed using current NASA infrastructure. This activity offers great potential for educational outreach by linking human exploration from Earth polar extremes to Earth orbital extremes to Lunar and Martian extremes. The outreach will use current NASA educational infrastructure. 

Background

This proposal resulted from prior collaborations when the Lead Contact was a crewmember and Science Officer on Expedition 6 to ISS. During this expedition, synchronized aurora observations were made between ISS and ground observers in Finland. Observations of Antarctic PMC were routinely made and subsequently correlated with SNOE satellite data with collaborators from University of Colorado and University of Alaska. These efforts proved the utility of making synchronized observations between ISS, ground, and satellite and resulted in this proposal. This proposal has been submitted with the approval of Dr. Jim Garvin, NASA Chief Scientist, in the NASA Washington DC office.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=16

This activity joints EoI n° 535 (LovenFLOWS presented by M. Griselin, France and EoI n° 233 (SUGLANET, presented by A. Eraso, Spain). The two teams worked together for a long time concerning Svalbard Hydrology and are linked by a convention between CNRS (French Scientific Research Center) and IPEV (French Polar Institute). The objective of this clustering project is to investigate the hydrology of polar and subpolar glacier basins. It is known that discharge of temperate glaciers (11.2 m3.s-1 km-2) is bigger than that coming from subpolar glaciers (0.20.3 m3.s-1 km-2), but also it is true that extension of subpolar glaciers (ca.750,000 km2) is 10 times bigger than that of temperate glaciers (ca.70,000 km2). By considering these data, the discharge of subpolar glaciers due to the global warming may be as important as those coming from temperate glaciers. However, the hydrological response of subpolar glaciers to atmospheric inputs is not well-know and may be precised by continuous monitoring of some parameters at key-locations on basins. New technologies in the fields of information and communication drastically increased the observation capacity of scientists. In very reactive environments such as polar regions, it is now possible to enhance qualitative and quantitative observations using automatic data collection sensor webs. The development of such networks is bringing new tools to answer hypothesis that were so far lacking a continuous database to be studied. Such is the situation of arctic hydro-systems for which the most data available over the last forty years are discontinuous, usually summer measurements. The originality of this program is to investigate the hydrology of glacier basins through continuous survey, over a period of several years, that is necessary to quantify the hydrosystems reactivity to climatic variations (hourly, daily, seasonally even yearly). Through this cluster, the dynamics of polar hydrology will be approached continuously at two different scales on 5 representative polar basins of Arctic (3) and Antarctic (2).

1. At a local scale, a sensor-web will be developed on the Loven East glacier (Svalbard): this glacier is representative of the alpine type glaciers of Svalbard and is hydrologically studied by the French and by the Spanish scientists since 40 years. The goal is to analyze liquid and solid fluxes from this hydro-system with a sensor web (both remote and in situ sensing). An environmental watch will be conducted in this area over a three years period through a network of photographic stations, hydrological sensors and meteorological stations. All the ground data will be transmitted automatically thus contributing to set up a true sensor web. The database will allow a global approach of spatial and temporal dynamics of the Loven East hydrosystem. Field surveys will also be conducted regarding the different inputs to the system. Remote sensing data, aerial photographs, meteorological data and hydrological information will allow the quantification of the system reactivity to contemporary climatic fluctuations. Experimental pilot catchment areas will be implemented to register glacier discharge continuously, recordering time series with hourly cycle-time of different hydrological parameters (water level, conductivity, water temperature, pH, solid contents). In laboratory, using correlative and spectral analysis between input time series (meteorological parameters as air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, precipitation amounts) and output time series (hydrological parameters), we will establish their characteristics in the time and frequency domains. The use of cross-correlogram for temperature and discharge, for example, will define the influence of air temperature to the glacier discharge, as well as its law of time distribution, that means the glacier response to weather changes and global warming. Chemical and isotopic analyses will be performed on water for completing the model of water circulation within the system (surface water, subglacial water and groundwater). 

2. At a global scale, the Spanish group started to develop the GLACE Project in 2001: GLAciers, Cryokarst and Environment (Proyecto GLACKMA, in Spanish). At the moment, 4 experimental pilot catchement have been implemented to assess the latitude effect on the hydrology of glaciers: 2 for temperate glaciers (Iceland at 64ºN and Patagonia at 51ºS) and two for polar glaciers (Svalbard at 79ºN and Insular Antarctica at 62ºS in subpolar glaciers). For all them, the discharge glacier is registering continuously. For the IPY, those stations will be maintained for generating time series in hourly frequencies like for the Loven East sensor-web. Additional new stations will be set up (at less one in the Antarctic Peninsula at S63º24 near ECARE, another in the Eastern Antarctica at 71ºS near Novolazarevskaya and another one around 70ºN latitude) for studying the variability of the global warming impact.

project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of
Polar Programs (OPP) to perform aerogeophysical research in
Antarctica. This project is part of the University of Texas at
Austin's Institute for Geophysics.

The airborne platform is a modified DeHavillandTwin Otter with
instrumentation to provide high-quality, integrated observations of
gravity, magnetics, surface elevation, and ice thickness.

The geophysical instrument suite carried aboard the airborne platform
consists of a gravity meter, magnetometer, laser altimeter and
ice-penetrating radar. Position information is provided by
differential GPS (both pseudo-range and carrier-phase), supplemented
by inertial navigation and precision pressure altimetry data. We
integrate these geophysical and positioning systems to obtain the
highest quality observations consistent with their simultaneous
operation.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In much of the interior of the North American continent, summer precipitation is a dominant feature of the annual cycle. Surface boundary conditions play an important role in initiation and maintenance of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS), which controls summer precipitation over much of this region. 

Understanding these processes is a focus for the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) (http://www.joss.ucar.edu/name/) . A working hypothesis of NAME is that among the land surface antecedent boundary conditions that control the onset and intensity of the NAMS is soil moisture. The influence of the land surface is relayed through surface evaporation and associated surface cooling (dependent on soil moisture), terrain, and vegetation cover. Soil moisture and, in particular, surface wetness, can change dramatically after heavy rain events. Increased soil moisture after precipitation promotes evapotranspiration between storm events. This may contribute to enhanced convection and further precipitation.

Whereas there have been a number of initiatives in recent years that have contributed to making space technologies available for humanitarian and emergency response UN-SPIDER is the first to focus on the need to ensure access to and use of such solutions during all phases of the disaster, including the risk reduction phase which will significantly contribute to an increasing reduction in loss of lives and property.

The UN-SPIDER programme is achieving this by focusing on being a gateway to space information for disaster management support, by serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities and by being a facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening, in particular for developing countries.

UN-SPIDER is being implemented as an open network of providers of space-based solutions to support disaster management activities. Besides Vienna (where UNOOSA is located), the Programme also has an office in Bonn, Germany and will also have an office in Beijing, China. Additionally, the Asian Disaster Reduction Center, Algeria, I.R. Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, South Africa, and Ukraine are setting up UN-SPIDER Regional Support Offices.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Assessment Program (OCSEAP,
1975-1985), was a program funded through the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop
baseline data in anticipation of oil development on Alaska's
Continental Shelf. The need for comprehensive geographic data
on the pelagic distribution of seabirds in Alaska and the
North Pacific has long been recognized. During the OCSEAP
Program millions of dollars were spent to gather data on the
pelagic distributions of marine birds and mammals on the
continental shelves. Ancillary data were routinely collected
on environmental conditions (e.g., ice, temperature,
salinity). This work culminated in an atlas on the "Pelagic
Distribution and Abundance of Seabirds in the Gulf of Alaska
and Eastern Bering Sea" (Gould et al. 1982), which documented
the at-sea distribution and abundance of 16 common seabird
species in Alaska. In addition to this work, extensive reports
by other key investigators!  laid the foundation for our
understanding of the pelagic biology and distribution of
seabirds in Alaska. A current version of the OCSEAP database
includes 248 data files, comprising &gt;60,000 standard transects
with &gt;325,000 records that document the environment,
distribution and group size of &gt;4,000,000 animals.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">RICE (Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution) Project is an international collaboration between New Zealand, USA, Denmark, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Italy and China. The aim of the project is to recover a 750 m deep ice core from Roosevelt Island in Antarctica to determine the stability of the Ross Ice Shelf and West Antarctica in a warming world.

The potential for rapid deglaciation of West Antarctica remains a primary uncertainty in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions for 21st Century sea level rise. The recent and unpredicted collapse of multiple ice shelves and rapid acceleration of discharge of Antarctic ice suggests that dynamical responses to warming play a more significant role than is currently understood and captured in coupled climate-ice sheet models. Such models can be improved and validated by replicating known past changes. The RICE Project is an international partnership seeking to understand past, present, and future changes of the Ross Ice Shelf, a major drainage pathway of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The ANDRILL programme showed, that about 5 to 3 million years ago, the last time when atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and temperatures were similar to those predicted for the end of the 21st Century, the Ross Ice Shelf disintegrated multiple times, initiating the collapse of West Antarctica. However, no high resolution data exist from this time period. To determine the rate of change, RICE aims to provide an annually resolved ice core record for the past 20,000 years and beyond, when global temperatures increased by 6 deg C to preindustrial temperatures, global sea level rose by ~120 m, and the Ross Ice Shelf grounding line retreated over 1,000 km. Most of the Ross Ice Shelf retreat occurred when global sea level had already reached modern levels. For this reason, the precise correlation between increasing air and ocean temperatures, and the velocity and characteristics of the ice shelf retreat, provides a unique opportunity to determine accurately the sensitivity of the Ross Ice Shelf to warming.

http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=325

To assess the impacts of climate change there is a need to significantly improve our understanding of Arctic Marine ecosystems. The lack of information in the Canadian Arctic Ocean on fish species distributions, their densities and ability to respond to climate change has implications for the development of new marine fisheries and ensuring that the current subsistence fisheries are sustainable. AMBER is part of an international cluster i.e by ArcOD, which deals with Arctic biodiversity. Many of the existing fisheries in the Arctic are dependent on the productivity of near shore coastal or estuarine ecosystems. Anadromous Arctic char, for example, obtain most of their energy during the short Arctic summer while feeding in the marine (estuarial) environment. Nunavuts largest commercial fishery is dependent on the deep-water marine ecosystems of Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. Climate change models suggest that global warming will impact these ecosystems. AMBER will intensely study three Arctic Marine inshore environments, which support large subsistence Arctic Char fisheries, and the deep-water ecosystem of Nunavuts Greenland Turbot fishery. AMBER will improve our understanding of the ecology of Arctic marine ecosystems so the impacts of climate change can be better assessed and help provide the information needed to take an ecosystem approach to the management and development of the Arctic marine fisheries resource. Furthermore, there is a need for much better linkages between the physical changes occurring in the marine environment and biota, including fish behaviour and feeding patterns. AMBER proposes to work with researchers and companies developing new technologies to monitor changes in ocean currents, salinity and temperature in order to correlate with fish distributions and energy requirements. We will develop energy models for inshore/estuarine fisheries and correlate with climate change scenarios and alien species invasions. The energy models will have direct application to inshore estuarine fisheries throughout the Arctic. Knowledge gained from AMBER will help northern communities plan for the impacts of Arctic warming and improve management of Arctic fisheries. By focusing AMBER on ecosystems which support important subsistence and commercial fisheries, AMBER will be able to effectively engage community participation in the project. Both of AMBERs project leads have extensive experience working with Arctic communities.
AMBER also proposes to study the inshore Arctic char fisheries associated with Iqaluit (Frobisher Bay, Nunavut), and Holman and Prince Albert Sound (Northwest Territories). The Iqaluit system represents a high tide estuarine marine environment; while Holman represents a near-shore marine environment influenced by ice melt. Both locations have community based fisheries management and monitoring programs that will be integrated into AMBER. The study of the Deep-water marine ecosystem associated with the Greenland turbot fishery will build on our current research underway in the Davis Strait, strengthen our international collaborations and expand the knowledge of Arctic marine food webs. AMBER will also increase the breadth and depth of knowledge on factors shaping Arctic marine biological communities by building new interdisciplinary synergies with the Early Warning System for Detecting Arctic Marine Ecosystem Change through the Use of Top Predators and Reconstructing the Surface of the Arctic Ocean Basin. As more is learned about the current distributions and densities of Arctic marine biota, an understanding of ocean currents and movements of fresh and saline waters, will undoubtedly be important in predicting future distributional patterns of biota.
AMBER will directly engage northern communities by incorporating and expanding existing community fisheries monitoring projects. The knowledge and experience gained through AMBER will provide the baseline information required to set ecosystem objectives and reference levels for monitoring the health of these important ecosystems. By including three different systems in AMBER, models will be developed which will aid other communities in developing monitoring programs. The interactions at the community level will involve schools, colleges, northern research Institutes and the local Hunters and Trappers Associations and the development of inshore environmental monitoring and fisheries training. The legacy will be an educational/training knowledge base, which will include technical skills and decision-making capabilities, along with monitoring buoys, which will be an integral part of the Arctic communities contribution to global models on climate change.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">From the IPCC Data Distribution Centre [http://www.ipcc-data.org/ddc_about.html] 

The DDC has been established to facilitate the timely distribution of a consistent set of up-to-date scenarios of changes in climate and related environmental and socio-economic factors for use in climate impacts assessments. The intention is that these new assessments can feed into the review process of the IPCC.

The initiative to establish a DDC grew out of a recommendation by the IPCC Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA). This Task Group was itself formed following a recommendation made at the IPCC Workshop on Regional Climate Change Projections for Impact Assessment (London, 24-26 September 1996).

The establishment of the DDC was approved by the IPCC Bureau at its Thirteenth session (9-11 July 1997) and it was subsequently determined at the XIIIth IPCC Plenary (Maldives, 22-28 September 1997) that the DDC would be a shared operation between the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) in the United Kingdom and the Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) in Germany. In 2003 a third centre, the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) in the USA, joined the DDC collaboration. From February 1st, 2007 British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) has replaced CRU as the United Kingdom partner.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Future of Marine Animal Populations (FMAP) is a network of scientists within the Census of Marine Life trying to understand the past, present and future of marine life. FMAP has a strong emphasis on statistical modeling of patterns derived from biological data, with a focus on data synthesis, often by means of meta-analysis.

FMAP attempts to describe and synthesize globally changing patterns of species abundance, distribution, and diversity, and to model the effects of fishing, climate change and other key variables on those patterns. This work is done across ocean realms and with an emphasis on understanding past changes and predicting future scenarios.

History &amp; Current Developments

FMAP grew out of a workshop held in Halifax, Nova Scotia (Canada) in June 2002. Representatives of the all major elements of the Census of Marine Life participated in this initial event and continue to contribute as the vision of FMAP evolves into a working program. Funding from the Sloan Foundation was in place as of the spring of 2003. 

Aside from predictions, FMAP will contribute to the Census of Marine Life in several key ways. Models are needed to design sampling programs and to synthesize data in order to understand what lived in the oceans in the past and what lives in the oceans today. These synthetic models can then be used to predict what will live in the oceans in the future. 

Moreover, modeling can help define the limits of knowledge: what is known, what is unknown but knowable, and what is likely to remain unknowable.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The JASIN (Joint Air-Sea Interaction) Project was designed to study
the interaction of the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers with
the large scale motions of the sea and air.

The primary aims were as follows:

1.  to observe and distinguish between the physical processes causing
mixing in the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers and relate them
to the mean properties of the layers

2. to examine and quantify aspects of the momentum and heat budgets in
the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers and fluxes across and
between them.

The multiplicity of processes sampled necessitated a large experiment
and JASIN involved 14 ships and 3 aircraft with more than 50 teams of
investigators from 9 countries. Altogether 35 mooring systems were
deployed. The experiment lasted for 2 months from mid-July to
mid-September 1978 and comprised 2 intensive observational phases
preceded by a preparatory test period. The Project took place in the
North Rockall Trough, an area of deep water (1000m - 2000m) several
hundred kilometres off the west coast of Scotland.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Southern elephant seal is a polygynous, sexual dimorphic species 
in which males are 4 -10 times greater ... than females. Males begin to 
arrive at the start of the breeding season and fight each other in 
areas where females will settle to give birth. When pregnant females 
begin to arrive, they gather in groups called harems. The result of 
the encounters between males is a dominance hierarchy at each breeding 
area, which reduces access to the grouped females to the 
highest-ranking males, thus allowing them to increase their breeding 
success. Male size is an important variable to take into account in 
this social structure; however, additional factors such as prior 
residence at the breeding area, male age, and time spent on the beach 
could also be variables that affect male social rank in the dominance 
hierarchy and thus male breeding success. 

By combining different techniques (paternity analyses, body 
measurements, daily censuses) we propose to study the breeding biology 
of southern elephant seals at Stranger Point, King George Island, 
identifying potential different strategies displayed by males to 
increase their breeding success.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Biogeography and Geological Diversity of Hydrothermal Venting on the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">We propose an international collaboration to study hydrothermal venting on the ultra-slow spreading Arctic mid-ocean ridge system. The Gakkel Ridge is a key target for hydrothermal studies because it has distinctive geological characteristics as a result of ultra-slow spreading (full spreading rate of 3-7 mm/yr), and because it is hydrographically isolated from the rest of the world’s ocean basins, which has important implications for vent field biological communities. In addition, major portions of the Arctic mid-ocean ridge system lie in deep water (&gt; 4000 m) under the ice pack, rendering them inaccessible to traditional deep submergence technologies. We are solving this problem by developing robotic vehicles that will be able to autonomously detect, localize, survey, and sample deep-sea vent fields under the Arctic ice pack. As a result, our project is technology intensive and involves a strong component of discovery while at sea, which, when combined with our scientific objectives produces a compelling project that is very much in line with the objectives and spirit of the International Polar Year.
Our major scientific themes are the geological diversity and biogeography of hydrothermal vents on the Arctic mid-ocean ridge system. Our major technology theme is autonomous exploration and sample return with an explicit mandate to develop techniques and methods for eventual use in astrobiology missions to search for life under the ice covered oceans of Europa, a moon of Jupiter (through funding from the US NASA). Our plan is to stage a series of at least two expeditions to different portions of the Arctic mid-ocean ridge during the IPY period (2007-2008). A US-led expedition will target suspected hydrothermal vent sites under "permanent" pack ice at 85E and 9E on the Gakkel Ridge, and a Norway-led expedition will target sites in seasonally ice-free water over the Mohns Ridge. The results of these two expeditions will be combined to reveal systematic patterns regarding biogeography (through both community-level and genetic-level investigations) of vent-endemic fauna, to study the differences between basalt vs. peridotite hosted vent fields, and to improve our understanding of hydrothermal circulation at ultra-slow spreading plate boundaries where amagmatic extension and long-lived faulting are the dominant mechanisms.
Through a combination of both traditional and novel instrumentation technologies we will conduct hydrographic surveys to constrain the size, shape, and composition of hydrothermal plumes in the water column above the vent fields. At the Mohns Ridge, the Norwegian led efforts will then proceed as usual for vent field studies in open water using an remotely operated vehicle (ROV). On the Gakkel Ridge the shape of the plume, and the location of the positively buoyant plume stem, in particular, will be used to localize the source vent fields to ≤ 100m, and this information will be used to guide autonomous surveys (with autonomous underwater vehicles - AUVs) to generate fine-scale microbathymetry maps and photomosaics of the vent fields. The photomosaic imagery will be used to identify immobile sampling targets, and an AUV equipped with a rudimentary manipulator/sampler will then be used to acquire immobile (e.g., sessile) samples. The PUMA and JAGUAR AUVs are presently under development at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for this mission, with a customized AUV-mounted manipulator being developed at the University of Maryland's Space Systems Laboratory. The AUVs will be tested under the Arctic ice pack in summer 2006 from the USCG Healy.
After the expeditions samples and survey data will be disseminated to collaborating scientists at various institutions within our international consortium, such that a comprehensive suite of measurements and analyses will be conducted. Our formal effort will conclude with an international workshop to disseminate our results and focus future initiatives. Major funding for our proposed research is already in hand (see Section 3.10) through the US National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs (Arctic Natural Sciences section) and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In addition, the Norwegian-led effort to find and study vent fields on the Mohns Ridge has already gotten off to a fantastic start with the major discovery of new vent fields during the summer 2005 field season (http://195.37.14.189/public_html/sciencewriteratsea/Norway2005/web-content/Navigation/press/Norway.html). Scientists and engineers in Japan and Germany will contribute to the project by providing key personnel and equipment for the various Arctic expeditions, and by collaborating in post-cruise analyses of survey and sample data.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Canadian Basin with its Beaufort Gyre (BG) contains about 45,000 km3 of fresh water (Aagaard and Carmack, 1989). This is the major reservoir of fresh water stored in the Arctic Ocean and its volume is 10-15 times larger than the total annual river runoff to the Arctic Ocean, and at least two times larger than the amount of fresh water stored in the sea ice. What is the mechanism of fresh water accumulation in the BG? A release of only 5% of this fresh water is enough to cause a salinity anomaly with the magnitude of the Great Salinity Anomaly of the 1970s.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=70

Objectives: 

1. To access the present scenario and interannual variability of physical properties in the Southern Ocean;

2. To monitor the circulation, zonal and meridional transport, surface atmospheric heat budget and linkage between Pacific and India Ocean, and to devise a framework for understanding the climate variability.

Observational program:

1. XBT/XCTD observations in the Indian Sector of the southern ocean to map the present state of oceanic environment; year to year variability will be monitorted using repeated sampling by using the Indian Antaractic expedition's logistic support on board the ice-class vessels sailing between Africa and India's Antarctic station- Maitri. Additional hydrographic work will be carried out in areas of water mass formation in the Ross and Weddell Seas and subantarctic zone.

2. Measurement of atmospheric stability parameters along the ship track to understand the zonal/meridional variations of boundary-level heat fluxes.

Linkages with other EOI's:

There is already integrated with science goals of CASO to establish a link between physical oceanography (of both continental margin and open ocean environments), biogeochemistry, ecology, sea ice studies, ocean-ice shelf interaction, meteorology, polar-low latitude teleconnections, and paleoclimate.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">US-ITASE</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">United States - International Trans Antarctic Scientific Expedition</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">From its original formulation in 1990, the International Trans Antarctic
Scientific Expedition (ITASE) has had as its primary aim the collection and
interpretation of a continental- wide array of environmental parameters
assembled through the coordinated efforts of scientists from several nations.
The primary planned product of this cooperative endeavor is the description and
understanding of environmental change in Antarctica over the last ~200 years.
As a demonstration of the importance of the original scientific objectives
posed by ITASE, they were adopted as a key science initiative by both the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) and the Scientific Committee
on Antarctic Research (SCAR).

In May 1996 a workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation was held to
develop a Science and Implementation Plan for the United States contribution to
ITASE (called "US ITASE"). Because of the long-standing US research effort in
West Antarctica, US ITASE chose to focus its activities in this region. At the
US ITASE Workshop, participants developed a multi-disciplinary research plan
that integrates meteorology, remote sensing, ice coring and surface glaciology,
and geophysics through a four-phase approach. In Phase 1 meteorological
modeling and remote sensing will be used to plan sampling strategies conducive
to the major objectives of US ITASE. Phase 2 will involve ground-based sampling
over four study areas (corridors). Although a broad spatial sampling of West
Antarctica is proposed during Phase 2, it is expected that the logistic
requirements for this sampling will be modest and highly efficient. Phase 3
allows for the continuation of ground-based sampling at a limited number of key
sites where monitoring is required. Phase 4 is interpretation and modeling.

In its entirety, ITASE incorporates a wide range of general scientific
objectives. Those which are specific to US ITASE address the following
questions:

1. What is the current rate of change in mass balance over West Antarctica?

2. What is the influence of major atmospheric circulation systems (e.g., ENSO)
and oceanic circulation on the moisture flux over West Antarctica?

3. How does climate (eg., temperature, accumulation rate, atmospheric
circulation) vary over West Antarctica on seasonal, interannual, decadal and
centennial scales, and what are the controls on this variability?

4. What is the frequency, magnitude and effect (local to global) of any extreme
climate events recorded in West Antarctica?

5. What is the impact of anthropogenic activity (e.g., ozone depletion,
pollutants) on the climate and atmospheric chemistry of West Antarctica?

6. How much has biogeochemical cycling of S, N and C, as recorded in West
Antarctica, varied over the last 200+ years?

US ITASE provides an important spatial perspective for the shared research
goals of a variety of research programs funded by the NSF, NASA and NOAA.
Notably, questions 1-4 parallel closely themes identified by NSF's WAIS (West
Antarctic Ice Sheet) intiative. It is expected that these overlaps of
scientific purposes will make possible an efficient utilization of logistic
resources in the execution of these linked research programs. 

A series of specific US ITASE products is proposed for the tentatively
scheduled 1997-2007 duration of this research effort. These products will
provide direct benefit to national scientific efforts as noted as well as
internationally based science programs developed through SCAR and IGBP. In
order to further this goal, this report was presented to the international
representatives attending the jointly sponsored GLOCHANT (SCAR) and PAGES
(IGBP) ITASE Workshop in Cambridge, England in August 1996. It is expected that
by the integration of US ITASE with the ITASE activities of other countries,
major contributions will be made to our understanding of Antarctica's role in
global change.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">IXTOC</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Ixtoc I was an exploratory oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, about 600 miles (970 km) south of the U.S. state of Texas. On June 3, 1979, the well suffered a blowout and is recognised as the second largest oil spill in history.

Mexico's government-owned oil company Pemex (Petróleos Mexicanos) was drilling a 2-mile (3.2 km) deep oil well, when the drilling rig lost drilling mud circulation. In modern rotary drilling, mud is circulated down the drill pipe and back up the casing to the surface. The goal is to equalize the pressure through the shaft and to monitor the returning mud for gas. Without the circulating mud, the drill ran into high pressure gas which blew out the oil (known as a blowout). The oil caught fire and the platform collapsed.

In the next few months, experts were brought in to contain and cap the oil well. Approximately 10 thousand to 30 thousand barrels per day were discharged into the Gulf until it was finally capped on March 23, 1980. Prevailing currents carried the oil towards the Texas coastline. The US government had two months to prepare booms to protect major inlets. Mexico declined the US requests for cleanup compensation.

The oil slick surrounded Rancho Nuevo, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which is one of the few nesting sites for Kemp's Ridley sea turtles. Thousands of baby sea turtles were airlifted to a clean portion of the Gulf of Mexico to help save this rare species.

The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) is the restructured civilian portion of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) that will make afternoon observations as it orbits Earth. The system includes the satellites and sensors supporting civil weather and climate measurements and a shared ground infrastructure with the Department of Defense weather satellite system.

NOAA is responsible for the JPSS program. NASA is the program’s procurement agent, and the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is the lead for acquisition. Data and imagery obtained from JPSS will increase the timeliness, accuracy and cost-effectiveness of public warnings and forecasts of climate and weather events, reducing the potential loss of human life and property.

Polar-orbiting satellites observe Earth from space and collect and disseminate data on Earth’s weather, atmosphere, oceans, land, and near-space environment and are able to monitor the entire planet and provide data for long-range weather and climate forecasts.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SOTER aims to establish a World Soils and Terrain Database, at scale 1:5 000 000, containing digitized map units and their attribute data in standardized format, using a uniform methodology. The programme is implemented by FAO, UNEP and ISRIC - World Soil Information, under the aegis of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS), in collaboration with a wide range of national soil institutes (1986 - present). 
 
ISRIC plays a lead role in methodology development and programme implementation. Space Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation data are being used to derive the different landform units and to generate terrain information; soil attribute data are largely derived from legacy field data. Ultimately, a global SOTER is to replace the FAO-Unesco Soil Map of the World (SMW), the first internationally accepted inventory of world soil resources.
 
SOTER databases are developed at scales ranging from 1:5 million to 1:500 000,  depending largely on the needs of the users (see datasets at: http://www.isric.org/UK/About+ISRIC/Projects/Track+Record/SOTER+data.htm). 

SOTER data have been used for a wide range of applications, including assessments of impacts of soil degradation on food supply, soil vulnerability to pollution and modelling of soil organic carbon stock and changes at national and regional levels.

The Nimbus 7 research-and-development satellite served as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of advanced systems for sensing and collecting data in the pollution, oceanographic and meteorological disciplines. The polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major structures: (1) a hollow torus-shaped sensor mount, (2) solar paddles, and (3) a control housing unit that was connected to the sensor mount by a tripod truss structure. Configured somewhat like an ocean buoy, Nimbus 7 was nearly 3.04 m tall, 1.52 m in diameter at the base, and about 3.96 m wide with solar paddles extended. The sensor mount that formed the satellite base housed the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the torus provided mounting space for sensors and antennas. A box-beam structure mounted within the center of the torus provided support for the larger sensor experiments. Mounted on the control housing unit, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors, horizon scanners, and a command antenna. The spacecraft spin axis was pointed at the earth. An advanced attitude-control system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to be controlled to within plus or minus 1 deg in all three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw). Eight experiments were selected: (1) limb infrared monitoring of the stratosphere (LIMS), (2) stratospheric and mesopheric sounder (SAMS), (3) coastal-zone color scanner (CZCS), (4) stratospheric aerosol measurement II (SAM II), (5) earth radiation budget (ERB), (6) scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR), (7) solar backscatter UV and total ozone mapping spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS), and (8) temperature-humidity infrared radiometer (THIR). These sensors were capable of observing several parameters at and below the mesospheric levels. More details can be found in "The Nimbus 7 Users' Guide" (TRF B30045) and "Nimbus-7 Data Product Summary" (NASA RP-1215), available from NSSDC.

Microbial communities, including phytoplankton, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, fungi and virus, are by far the most abundant and the most taxonomic and genetically diverse group of organisms in marine pelagic ecosystems. Biological activity, biomass, production and remineralization in these systems are essentially microbial while higher trophic levels (crustaceans, fish, and mammals) play a minor role in quantitative terms. Microorganisms are the main drivers of biogeochemical cycles and the major producers and consumers of green-house gases, and they are therefore significant players in regulating the ecosphere. In addition, they can be important sentinels of environmental change, as alterations in the structure and biomass of microbial communities can herald changes not only in pathways of nutrient and energy transfer in foodwebs, but also in biogeochemical cycles. Despite their abundance and likely importance in polar ecosystems, very little is known about the composition of polar microbial communities, their interactions and geochemical roles, or their response to environmental changes.

The PAME program will focus on polar marine microorganisms and their activities; the processes that relate to these organisms and the significance of these organisms and their activity with respect to climate and global environmental change. The projects participating in PAME will target different aspects of microbial ecology in different polar areas. Projects may also encompass studies undertaken in warmer latitudes where these compliment and inform polar research. Field campaigns, logistics and research will be coordinated through PAME, and the projects will share and exchange data, samples, field opportunities, infrastructure, human and intellectual resources in order to obtain better and more complete datasets from field surveys and experimental studies than otherwise would be possible. 
Understanding microbial food web structure and function involves major research tasks related to community composition, population dynamics and flux of energy and matter. 

PAME will assess microbial biodiversity and community composition employing a full range of approaches from classical taxonomic studies to metagenomics of community DNA. The work will include development and application of state-of-the-art molecular methods to detect, enumerate and monitor sentinel ("indicator") microbial genes, functions and taxa, and to determine the molecular biodiversity of key microbial groups. Population dynamics, trophic interactions and flow of energy and matter between different microbial compartments and biogeochemical pools will be investigated both during field campaigns and in experimental ecosystem models (mesocosms). Experimental approaches to climate and environmental change, as well as mathematical modelling, will be integral parts of this work. The overriding aim is to understand how external and internal driving forces and control mechanisms regulate microbial processes and how they affect community structure and biogeochemical cycles.

The primary goal of the GRACE mission is to accurately map variations in the Earth's gravity field over its 5-year lifetime. The GRACE mission has two identical spacecrafts flying about 220 kilometers apart in a polar orbit 500 kilometers above the Earth.
      
It maps the Earth's gravity fields by making accurate measurements of the distance between the two satellites, using geodetic quality Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and a microwave ranging system. This provides scientists from all over the world with an efficient and cost-effective way to map the Earth's gravity fields with unprecedented accuracy. The results from this mission yield crucial information about the distribution and flow of mass within the Earth and it's surroundings.
      
The gravity variations that GRACE studies include: changes due to surface and deep currents in the ocean; runoff and ground water storage on land masses; exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the oceans; and variations of mass within the Earth. Another goal of the mission is to create a better profile of the Earth's atmosphere. The results from GRACE make a huge contribution to NASA's Earth science goals, Earth Observation System (EOS) and global climate change studies.
      
GRACE is a joint partnership between the NASA in the United States and Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fur Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Germany. Dr. Byron Tapley of The University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR) is the Principal Investigator (PI), and Dr. Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam is the Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI).

Project URL: http://www.annee-polaire.fr/api/la_recherche_francaise_et_l_api/81_collaborative_research_into_antarctic_calving_and_iceberg_evolution
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=81

CRAC-ICE will be a coordinated investigation into calving processes on three major Antarctic ice shelves, and a (long-term) monitoring of icebergs in the Southern Ocean, including the study of the physical processes related to iceberg drift and decay. The processes leading to a calving event include the initiation and propagation of through-cutting rifts. Iceberg calving can result in a significant loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet, and represents ~ 65% of the total ice sheet ablation. Therefore, it is critical to understand the processes which precede and lead up to a major calving event in order to realistically assess how future climate changes might affect the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Post-calving, iceberg drift is influenced by the shape of the coastline, bottom topography, and a combination of tides, currents, wind, and sea ice. Monitoring the evolution of icebergs as they drift into warmer waters provides a valuable experiment in how rapid climate change influences ice shelves - especially such components as firn compaction, the impact of surface meltwater, ponding, and iceberg break-up. Grounded icebergs cause a severe devastation of the sea floor, forcing benthic communities to re-colonise. Iceberg melting and decay represents a significant source of freshwater (and mineral dust) primarily into the upper layers of the Southern Ocean's northern fringe. A stabilisation of the weakly stratified water column has important and poorly understood consequences for sea ice and water masses involved in deep and bottom water formation, and the biology of the euphotic zone. 

CRAC-ICE's first objective is to develop an understanding of the mechanics of ice shelf rift initiation and propagation via three complementary components:
1. Fieldwork: Networks of autonomous observation stations (GPS, seismometers, webcams and AWS) will be deployed around selected rift tips on each ice shelf for one year. The measurements will be combined with oceanographic measurements of currents, temperature and salinity, and significant wave heights. These mirror campaigns will provide a continuous time series of rift widening (GPS) as well as rupture locations and source mechanisms (seismic), which can be compared with environmental effects such as large storms. Ground penetrating radar profiles will be collected, to probe the subsurface structure of the rift. Cores will be taken of the mélange inside each rift to determine its composition. On the Ross Ice Shelf, autonomous vertical profilers will be installed beneath a rift to monitor ocean currents and mixing, and to take depth profiles of salinity and temperature on a daily basis for one year. 
2. Satellite data analysis: Satellite images (e.g. MODIS, MISR, ASTER, RADARSAT) provide "snapshot" observations of the surface expression of the rift at discrete time intervals. Image pairs provide estimates of velocity, ice strain rates, and rift widening rates on much larger spatial and temporal scales than the ground-based measurements. InSAR analysis using Radarsat will provide rift deformation rates. ICESat/CryoSat laser and radar altimeter data will be used to provide surface profile information for each rift and estimate mélange thickness.
3. Modeling: Physical modelling, using a large ice tank, will be used to simulate ice shelf behaviour over a range of conditions. The results from these experiments, along with data collected in (1) and (2), will be used to construct realistic suites of numerical models of ice shelves which explicitly include fracture physics. This will enable careful hypothesis testing of the mechanisms and processes which occur during ice shelf break up - including the effect of mélange within rifts.

CRAC-ICE's second objective is the monitoring of iceberg evolution as they drift away from their calving sites, based on:
1. Shipbased observations near drifting bergs, including the deployment of autonomous observation stations on icebergs of various sizes equipped with sensors for position, air pressure, strain and tilt, reporting via the ARGOS system.
2. Satellite data analysis using imagery (e.g. Envisat, Radarsat, ALOS) with different spatial resolution. A pattern-recognition algorithm will be applied to identify and track icebergs with minimum lengths between 200 - 500 m (depending on pixel size). Radar imagery will be used to monitor the physical changes in icebergs (surface melting, firn compaction, ponding, etc.) from their sites of calving through to their final break-up. Estimates of the total mass loss (and related freshwater flux) will be made by combining size information from satellite imagery with freeboard elevation from satellite altimetry (ICESat, CryoSat, Envisat), both compared with modeled melt rates. 
3. Modeling of iceberg drift to guide image acquisition. The simulated track will be used to bridge the interval between a pair of images. Modeled side wall (including wave erosion) and basal melting will be used to verify the observed mass losses due to size and freeboard reductions.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">IPY Operational Oceanography for the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Arctic climate of the 20th century has undergone major fluctuations, which are characterized by a significant warming in the last two decades. The warming predicted for the high Arctic is 3–4 °C in winter during the next 50 years, more than twice the global average, while the ice cover is predicted to be reduced by ~80% during summer and ~20% during winter. This suggests that the Arctic may be where the most rapid and dramatic climate changes take place during the 21st century, with major ramifications for mid-latitude climate.
The sea ice cover has over the last 2-3 decades decreased by ~10%, and the ice thickness has decreased up to 40% during summer. Other observed changes include a warming of the Atlantic water in the Arctic Ocean, increased precipitation in the Arctic regions and higher river discharge into the Arctic ocean. During the last decades detected changes include a significant freshening of the deep North Atlantic Ocean, warming in the deep water of the Nordic Seas and a decrease of deep overflow in the Faeroe Bank Channel. The oceanic fluxes of heat and freshwater between the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean are key components of the high-latitude climate system.
The recent Arctic Climate Impact Assessment studies have identified a number of severe impacts of Arctic warming on society. Changes in air temperature, precipitation, river discharge, sea ice, permafrost, glaciers and sea level have been documented and further changes are expected in the next decades. The Arctic region is coming under increasing pressure from unsustainable development with pollution and other negative effects on the environment. The exploitation of resources, including sea transportation and offshore operations will be heavily affected by the climate- variability and long-term changes at high latitudes. The northeast Atlantic, including Greenland and Icelandic waters, the Barents Sea and other Arctic ice edge regions, provides 20% of the world’s fish catch. Ocean temperature is one of the key variables that have influence on fisheries. Various offshore operations in ice-covered waters will increase such as offshore exploration, drilling, oil and gas production, and gas transportation, pipeline deployment in the seabed, and building of terminals in several locations along the Arctic coasts. All these activities will increase the risk of accidents and severe pollution of the fragile Arctic environment.
The Arctic areas have rough weather and ice conditions which require improvement of operational monitoring and forecasting services in order to safeguard all types of marine and coastal operations. The operational services should also include long-term data archiving services to build up statistics of the environmental conditions. Operational services on met-ice-ocean conditions in theses areas are extremely important for safe and cost-effective industrial and transport activities as well as for protection of the vulnerable environment.
The overall objective of IPY Arctic GOOS to develop and implement operational monitoring and forecasting systems in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. The systems will be based on state-of-the-art remote sensing, in situ observations, numerical modelling, data assimilation and dissemination techniques. The activities will include the development and maintenance of observing system for sea ice and physical, chemical and biological ocean parameters. The observing systems need to including icebergs, potential oil spills, radioactive spreading and other pollutants. In addition to observations, the systems will include numerical modelling and data assimilation for production of short-term forecasts. New models and data assimilation techniques need to be developed where needed. A long-term objective is to develop modelling systems for seasonal prediction of sea ice, hydrographic and current conditions. State-of-the-art climate models will be used to quantify climate change and variability and prediction of future climate changes under greenhouse gas scenarios.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Radionuclides can serve as valuable tracers of atmospheric and terrestrial transport processes, which will be altered by changing climate patterns. This project is anchored in the existing Health Canada radiological monitoring network operated throughout Canada. The network includes seven Arctic sites equipped with high volume samplers for airborne particulates. Two of these sites are also equipped for noble gas collection and one site is equipped with a continuous gamma radiation monitor. In addition to the primary functions of supporting of the Canadian Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan and the international Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the network provides regular measurements of a wide range of naturally-occurring radionuclide concentrations in air. Heavy metals and some organic compounds will also be measured in airborne particulates collected by the air samplers. An archive of air filters extending back to the early 1970s will allow the elucidation of time trends in these contaminants. The Health Canada air monitoring network covers an area extending from 55o to 83o North Latitude and 60o to 135o West Longitude, representing a large fraction of the entire land mass in the North polar region.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">ARM Enhanced Shortwave Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
ARESE, the ARM Enhanced Shortwave Experiment, concluded a very
successful deployment to Oklahoma on November 1, 1995. The purpose of
this five week long campaign was to conduct a series of instrumented
flights to measure the interaction of solar energy with clear and
cloudy skies to provide additional insight into recent observations of
enhanced absorption in cloudy atmospheres.As such, ARESE focused on
two scientific objectives: (1) the direct measurement of the
absorption of solar radiation by clear and cloudy atmospheres and the
placement of bounds on these measurements; and

(2) the investigation of the possible causes of absorption in excess
    of the model predictions.

To accomplish these objectives, ARESE used a combination of satellite,
  aircraft, and ground observations to make highly accurate solar flux
  measurements at different altitudes throughout the atmospheric
  column. At the heart of this was a carefully "stacked" Twin Otter
  and Egrett "cloud sandwich" with the Otter at 1500 - 5000 ft and the
  Egrett at 43,000 ft. This was overflown by an ER-2 flying at 65,000
  ft, which because of its much higher speed did not stay in constant
  alignment with the Twin Otter/Egrett stack but did provide periodic
  coincidences with these other aircraft. All three aircraft carried
  identical up- and down-looking "Valero" radiometers and flew over
  identical up-looking radiometers at the CART central and extended
  facilities. Radiance measurements from the GOES satellites were used
  to retrieve top-of-the atmosphere fluxes. These flux measurements
  were supplemented by a variety of cloud property measurements from
  the ground, the Egrett and the ER-2, including!  radar, lidar and
  multispectral measurements.

These baseline ARESE flights were conducted at the CART site from
September 25 through November 1. During that time we flew twelve
scientific data flights and accumulated approximately 60 hours of
in-flight data under a variety of atmospheric conditions ranging from
clear to solid overcast. These flights are detailed in the table below
and include: cloud forcing experiments under scattered, broken, and
solid overcast conditions including low, mid-, and high-level cloud
decks; clear sky column absorption and surface albedo measurements;
clear sky flux profiling measurements; and in-flight, co- altitude
intercomparisons of flux measurements made from the two aircraft. The
data appear to be of excellent quality and comprise a unique data set
for testing our understanding of the absorption of solar radiation in
both clear and cloudy atmospheres.

In addition to these baseline solar absorption experiments, the ER-2
also performed some key calibration experiments. These used highly
accurate spectral radiance measurements from the MODIS Airborne
Simulator (MAS) to calibrate radiance measurements from the GOES
satellite and to improve retrieval algorithms for converting spectral
radiances to spectral fluxes.

The success of this deployment was the result of the tremendous
efforts of a multi-laboratory multiagency team comprised of five DOE
Laboratories, three NASA Centers, about a dozen universities and three
aircraft companies. The ARM Program sponsored the ground-based
measurements, ARM-UAV (Unmanned Aerospace Vehicle) the coordinated
Egrett and Otter measurements, and ARM and NASA the ER-2
flights. Funding was provided through the DOE's ARM Program and
through DoD's Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program
(SERDP).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

Description: Canada and the United States carried out an atmospheric
research program called the Eulerian Model Evaluation Field Study
(EMEFS) from June 1, 1988 to May 31, 1990 under the coordination and
management of a bi-lateral, multi-agency Project Management Group
(PMG).  The objective of the program was to collect daily air and
precipitation chemistry data for use in evaluating two Eulerian
long-range transport models: the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM)
developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the
Atmospheric Deposition and Oxidants Model (ADOM) developed jointly by
Environment Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy,
the German Umweltbundesamt, and the Electric Power Research Institute.
Data collected have been and continue to be used to evaluate estimates
of sulfate (SO4=) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in air and
precipitation.  The field component of EMEFS had two parts:
1) a surface network designed to collect data for operational model
evaluations, i.e., over long-periods and large spatial scales, and 2)
intensive surface and aircraft field campaigns to support short-term
diagnostic model evaluations.  The EMEFS surface network consisted of
approximately 130 sites in five networks sponsored by different
governmental and non-governmental agencies.  Site selection was
coordinated by the agencies to establish a regionally representative
network.  The five networks were:
OEN: Operational Evaluation Network - funded by the Electric Power
Research Institute (25 EMEFS sites)
CAPMoN: Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network - operated
by Environment Canada, Atmospheric Environment Service (22 EMEFS
sites)
FADMP: Florida Acid Deposition Monitoring Program - funded by the
Florida Electric Power Coordinating Group (4 EMEFS sites)
APIOS: Acid Precipitation In Ontario Study - operated by the Ontario
Ministry of Environment and Energy (18 EMEFS sites).
Acid MODES: Acid Model Operational Diagnostic Evaluation Study -
funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (59 EMEFS sites
including variability (VAR) and gradient (GRAD) special study
sub-networks).  The Acid MODES variability sub-network was a four-site
cluster of sites used to evaluate spatial concentration variability on
the 80 - 100 km grid scale of the models being evaluated.  The
gradient sub-network similarly provided a higher spatial network
resolution in an area where sharp spatial concentration gradients were
observed in previous studies.

State and local government officials have long struggled with the
complexity involved in protecting and improving water quality in their
jurisdictions. Due to technical, environmental, and regulatory
complications, these officials have grappled with this important
issue, often coming up short of a workable, consistent plan for water
resource management. Recently, scientific literature has shown that
the amount of impervious surface in a watershed proves to be a useful,
easily identifiable indicator of overall water quality. In response to
this finding, the Towson University Center for Geographic Information
Sciences (CGIS) and its partners--the Towson University Department of
Geography and Environmental Planning, the Maryland Space Grant
Consortium, the Washington College Center for the Environment and
Society, and the Maryland Virtual High School--completeda project to
map impervious cover for the entire Chesapeake Bay and Maryland
Coastal Bays watersheds. The goal of this project is to supply state
and local official with the impervious surface data and with the
technical and theoretical background they need to integrate
imperviousness into their water quality protection measures.

To complete the impervious surface mapping project, CGIS used remote
sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to
identify pervious and impervious land cover types throughout the
Chesapeake Bay and Maryland Coastal Bays watersheds. The data was then
"clipped" by watershed and county boundaries tomake the information as
useful as possible to its intended audience--state and local
government officials. This data was then uploaded onto a CGIS server
to be distributed to its end users via an online Infomart, complete
with raw remotely sensed data (Landsat 7 EMT+), geospatial data, and
background information onremote sensing/digital image
processing. Additionally, the Infomart contains a link for K-12
teachers, which includes lesson plans on imperviousness that teachers
can use within their classrooms. K-12 teachers and their students have
already played an integral role in the impervious surface project by
ground truthing over 15,000 land-cover points, using portable GPS
units supplied to them by CGIS. Finally, the Infomart serves as the
focus of a Project NEMO (Non-Point Education of Municipal Officials),
university-based outreach program to educategovernment officials on
watershed ecology, imperviousness, and potential mitigation measures.

valuable assistance from the National Science Foundation, the
Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, and the National Imagery

In 1997, the Canadian RADARSAT-1 satellite was rotated in orbit, so
that its synthetic aperture radar (SAR) antenna looked south towards
Antarctica. This permitted the first high-resolution mapping of the
entire continent of Antarctica. In less than three weeks, the
satellite acquired a complete coverage of radar image swaths as part
of the first Antarctic Mapping Mission (AMM-1). Swath images have been
assembled into an image mosaic depicting the entire continent at 25 m
resolution. The mosaic provides a detailed look at ice sheet
morphology, rock outcrops, research infrastructure, the coastline, and
other features of Antarctica, as well as representing calibrated radar
backscatter data which may provide insight into climate processes
affecting the upper few meters of snow cover.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

Columbia Basin Research (CBR) is a joint effort of scientific
research projects through the School of Aquatic and Fishery
Sciences at the University of Washington under the leadership of
James Anderson and John Skalski.

We investigate issues surrounding salmon biology in the Columbia
and Snake River basins. Our research has produced computer
models which simulate and predict salmon migration and survival
in the Columbia Basin and salmon harvest in the North
Pacific. We also function as a secondary database site,
providing data and tools to analyze salmon issues in Columbia
Basin. As a secondary database site, we add value to the data
through statistical analysis and modeling activities.

The Columbia Basin Research group occupies an office in downtown
Seattle (see directions for exact location). Currently, the CBR
group has 15+ staff members including two faculty members,
research consultants, computer programmers, database manager,
graduate students, system administrator, program administrators,
and various other staff. CBR has multiple computing
capabilities, including Win32 and Unix, and multiple database
capabilities, including Ingres and Oracle.

The response of terrestrial and marine coastal systems to ongoing climate change

The Western Antarctic Peninsula is getting warmer and warmer. Rapid regional warming of air temperatures observed over the last fifty years has been exceptional and unprecedented within the past 500 years.  As a consequence, glaciers are retreating and leaving new ice-free areas for primary colonization of terrestrial and near shore marine plants and animals.

The ClicOPEN initiative is aimed at investigating the response of terrestrial and marine coastal systems to ongoing climate change along this area.  The project is land based and uses existing Antarctic research stations in four different areas of the Antarctic Peninsula as platforms for synoptic field and laboratory studies during the IPY. It will start during the Antarctic summer of 2006/2007.

The objectives within the ClicOPEN approach are dual:
A) to analyze and quantify effects of glacial melting and increased rock erosion on terrestrial and near shore marine ecosystems on a latitudinal gradient along the Western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. 
B) to provide a basis for a mechanistic understanding of climate change processes at the peninsula that will serve to draw a link to present and future changes in more remote shelf regions of the Southern Ocean. 

ClicOPEN is land based and uses existing Antarctic research stations in 4 different areas of the Antarctic Peninsula as platforms for synoptic field and laboratory studies during the IPY. Comparative work at McMurdo, Ross Sea is intended. A station based programme enables us to include many scientists into cooperative and comparative work, make use of the existing logistic background provided by field stations and home institutions, and also to draw from historical data sets in locations of long-term scientific records, including temperature records and documented contours of ice caps and glaciers.

The Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) is a measure of
overall progress towards environmental sustainability, developed
for 142 countries. The ESI scores are based upon a set of 20 core
"indicators," each of which combines two to eight variables for a
total of 68 underlying variables. The ESI permits cross-national
comparisons of environmental progress in a systematic and
quantitative fashion. It represents a first step towards a more
analytically driven approach to environmental decisionmaking.

The documents made available here provide in-depth details on the
analytical framework, quantitative methodology, and data sources
that underlie the ESI . We welcome criticisms, suggestions, and

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">A Polar Atlas for Education and Outreach based on a Spatial Data Infrastructure</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: Polar Atlas
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=176

The Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre (GCRC) at Carleton University in collaboration with Natural Resources Canada, the Canadian Polar Commission, and the International polar science community proposes the development of an on-line Polar Atlas (henceforth The Atlas) for the purpose of IPY Education and Outreach. The Atlas is envisioned as significantly contributing to making IPY activities and results accessible to students, teachers, the media, policy makers, scientists, and the general public. The Atlas will enable users to interact with information on a wide range of topics identified as IPY themes including environmental change and human activity in the polar regions. One of the technological contributions of the proposed activity will be an Atlas that enables users to contribute content, thus involving polar community residents in meaningful ways.

Beyond the project focus on Education and Outreach, the project will generate Canadian contributions to an infrastructure that will enable the open, free, and unrestricted access to data and information generated through the IPY programme. The Atlas will be developed on a Spatial Data Infrastructure model and the data management structures being developed by the International community (EoI 409/ proposal 49). A key national element of the SDI development strategy is partnership with Natural Resources Canada, specifically the activities related to EoI 993. The members of The Atlas proposal will take a lead role in the research aspects of the project while members of the EoI 993 proposal will lead with respect to community liaison in the Arctic and infrastructure development.

The primary project activity is to promote education and outreach by making the findings from IPY accessible to a wide range of participants. An on-line atlas developed on a SDI can provide a valuable mechanism that allows experts and non-experts alike to access information. We are currently developing such an atlas for the Antarctic region through a major collaborative research grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada. This atlas is being developed through international partnerships and is entitled the SCAR Cybercartographic Atlas of Antarctica (CAA) (http://www.carleton.ca/gcrc/caap). We have significant expertise and existing infrastructure that will facilitate extending the current Atlas framework to include both polar regions. We have partnered with several Arctic-related projects: 1) Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic (EoI 358 to be submitted as a full proposal for September 30) and 2) Inuit Sea Ice Use and Occupancy Project (EoI 715, situated within a cluster initiative entitled SIKU (Sea Ice Knowledge and Use in the Arctic) to be submitted as a full proposal for September 30). To ensure that our efforts are integrated with other international efforts, we are collaborating with the Polar Post Project (EoI 469) led by the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in the United States that shares many similar objectives to the proposed Atlas. We have initiated discussions with other Canadian education-related projects such as Mission Antarctique (EoI 465) and will continue to pursue collaborative activities to enrich the proposed Atlas. 

The Atlas development as proposed will require an available network of data such as a SDI or an observatory network as proposed by the eGy (Electronic Geophysical Year). We are actively involved in SDI development for the Antarctic (see section 3.6). The development of the Arctic component of the SDI will be carried out through national (EoI 993) and international partnerships. To ensure that the SDI components for the two Polar Regions are compatible, we will collaborate and coordinate efforts with other geoscientific information management initiatives, including the IPY DIS (Proposal 49) and the related Circumarctic Environmental Observatories Network/ARCUS (Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, EoI 265), the Joint Committee on Antarctic Data Management and the SCAR Experts Group on Geospatial Information.

Our project will span the two-year observation period of IPY (1 March 2007-1 March
2009) and beyond.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Changing economies and patterns of trade, rather than climatic deterioration, could
have critically marginalized the Norse Greenland settlements and effectively sealed their fate.
Counter-intuitively, the end of Norse Greenland might not be symptomatic of a failure to adapt
to environmental change, but a consequence of successful wider economic developments of
Norse communities across North Atlantic. Data from Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and medieval
Iceland is used to explore the interplay of Norse society with climate, environment, settlement,
and other circumstances. Long term increases in vulnerability caused by economic change and
cumulative climate changes sparked a cascading collapse of integrated interdependent settlement systems, bringing the end of Norse Greenland.

Since 1991, NOAA's National Marine Mammal Laboratory Laboratory (NMML)
in Seattle, Washington and Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory
(PMEL) in Newport,  Oregon, have collaborated on a joint study to
assess the potential of long-range acoustic monitoring of free-ranging
populations of large cetaceans. NMML brings many years of experience
in population stock assessment based on field observations, with
supporting data on habitat, near-field acoustics and behavior. PMEL
brings expertise in underwater acoustics and access to both the
U.S. Navy's underwater SOund SUrveillance System ( SOSUS) and
autonomous moored hydrophone recorders designed for long-term,
deep-ocean deployment. This joint study has been largely funded
through the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program
(SERDP), with additional support from the Office of Naval Research
(ONR), NOAA's Environmental Services Data and Information Management
(ESDIM) Program, NMML, and the NOAA VENTS program at PMEL.

This powerful combination of SOSUS and autonomous moored hydrophone
data has enabled PMEL researchers to record the low-frequency calls of
blue and fin whales throughout the Pacific Ocean, and to identify
regional differences in blue and fin whale vocalizations. Locating
calling whales also enables PMEL to identify apparent seasonal shifts
in whale distributions. Correlating these data with NMML current field
observations and their extensive historical database of species
distributions may help answer critical population and stock management
questions.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Executive Order 13158 defines marine protected areas (MPAs) as "any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by Federal, State, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein." There are many different types of MPAs in U.S. waters.  Varying Definitions of MPAs Different Types and Characteristics of MPAs Working Definition for the MPA Inventory References

Varying Definitions of MPAs

The term "marine protected area" has been in use for over two decades. The concept of marine protected areas has been around for centuries. A marine protected area has come to mean different things to different people, based primarily on the level of protection provided by the MPA. Some see MPAs as sheltered or reserved areas where little, if any, use or human disturbance should be permitted. Others see them as specially managed areas designed to enhance ocean use. Many accept the definition developed by the World Conservation Union: "any area of the intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment" (IUCN, 1988; Kelleher, 1999).  Not too different is the definition in Marine Protected Areas Executive Order 13158. This defines an MPA as "any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by Federal, State, territorial, tribal or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein" (Federal Register, 2000). Under this broad definition, a wide variety of sites could be considered as MPAs. 

There are many different types of MPAs in the United States. For example, U.S. MPAs may include national marine sanctuaries, fishery management zones, national seashores, national parks, national monuments, critical habitats, national wildlife refuges, national estuarine research reserves, state conservation areas, state reserves, and many others. MPAs have different shapes, sizes, and management characteristics, and have been established for different purposes. 

MPAs provide different levels of protection and use. They range from areas closed to public access, such as Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Key Largo, Florida (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2001); to sites that permit access but do not allow consumptive uses, such as Edmonds Underwater Park in Washington (Murray,1998); to areas where the use of specific types of fishing gear is restricted, such as certain fishery management areas; and to multiple-use areas, such as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (National Ocean Service (a), 2000).

MPAs also protect a variety of specific natural and cultural resources. The near-shore Bristol Bay fishery closure area off Alaska protects king crab aggregations and habitat important to this valuable fisheries species (Code of Federal Regulations, 2000). The Virgin Islands National Park protects coral reef habitat and sea-turtle nesting areas (National Park Service, 1998). Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge protects habitat for endangered species such as the Hawaiian monk seal, coral reefs, and historical artifacts from the famous World War II battle that occurred there (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2001). The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of North Carolina protects the site of this famous Civil War-era shipwreck (National Ocean Service (b), 2000).

MPAs can range dramatically in size and shape. There are small areas, such as the 14-acre Farnsworth Bank Ecological Reserve in Los Angeles County, California (McArdle, 1997), and large areas, such as the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in California, which covers 5,300 square miles (National Ocean Service (c), 2000).

MPAs differ in location and jurisdiction. Some MPAs are in federal waters only, which, for the most part, extend from three to 200 miles offshore. These are managed under federal laws by federal agencies. Some MPAs are found only in state waters where both state and federal laws may apply. MPAs may overlap. The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park share jurisdiction over some ocean waters (National Academy of Public Administration, 2000). Finally, some MPAs, such as the Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts, include both marine and land components (Bauman et al., 1998).

The Schools of the Pacific Rainfall Climate Experiment (SPaRCE)
is a cooperative field project involving local meteorological
services, elementary, middle school, high school, college, and
trade school students from various Pacific islands, atolls, and
the U.S.  The SPaRCE program (headquartered at the University of
Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma) began in January 1993 with only a
handful of Pacific schools. Since its implementation, the
project has quickly grown.  There are currently over 160 schools
from approximately 22 different countries enrolled.

Goals of the SPARCE Program:

1. Increase the number of rain gauges, as well as other
meteorological instrumentation, across the Pacific and
incorporate collected observations into a comprehensive Pacific
database to be used for climate research purposes

2. Foster interest and increase the awareness among students and
teachers of the need for cooperation among different nations in
investigating potential climate change

3. Educate students and teachers about the importance of
rainfall (particularly in the Pacific region) to climate studies

4. Provide the students and teachers with an opportunity to make
a major contribution to the global climate research effort by
collecting and analyzing Pacific meteorological data

5. Foster scientific and cultural exchange between students from
different countries

The Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) is a NASA-sponsored
satellite mission that will provide state-of-the-art measurements of
incoming x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, near-infared, and total solar
radiation. The measurements provided by SORCE specifically address
long-term climate change, natural variability and enhanced climate
prediction, and atmospheric ozone and UV-B radiation. These
measurements are critical to studies of the Sun; its effect on our
Earth system; and its influence on humankind.

SORCE was successfully launched on January 25, 2003 on a Pegasus XL
launch vehicle to provide NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) with
precise measurements of solar radiation. It was launched into a 645
km, 40 degree orbit and will be operated by the Laboratory for
Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado
(CU) in Boulder, Colorado, USA. It will continue the precise
measurements of total solar irradiance (TSI) that began with the ERB
instrument in 1979 and has continued to the present with the ACRIM
series of measurements. SORCE will also provide the measurements of
the solar spectral irradiance from 1nm to 2000nm, accounting for 95%
of the spectral contribution to TSI. SORCE will carry four instruments
including the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM), Solar Stellar Irradiance
Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE), Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM),
and the XUV Photometer System (XPS).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A numerical model is developed for mariculture management, which consists of: (1) calculation of spatial distribution of PON (particulate organic nitrogen) using simulated current, (2) calculation of spatial distribution of DO (dissolved oxygen), (3) calculation of DON (dissolved organic nitrogen), (4) calculation of spatial distribution of DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen), and (5) calculation of the horizontal distribution of accumulated matter which is supplied by deposits from the mariculture of fish. This model is capable of calculating the detailed spatial distribution of PON, DON, DIN and DO by dividing the bay into many grid points. It also takes into consideration the effects of feed and fish in each raft, and the loading of DIN from rivers. The model is applied to Shizugawa Bay, in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. The model elucidated the oxygen cycle among ecological compartments. The amount of dissolved oxygen supplied by photosynthesis is much greater than the consumption through respiration by fish and all other conditions for mariculture of fish are favourable in this bay.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Geologic Remote Sensing Field Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This set of compact read-only optical disks (CD-ROMs) contains a data
collection acquired by ground-based and airborne instruments during
the Geologic Remote Sensing Field Experiment (GRSFE). Extensive
documentation is also included. GRSFE took place in July, September,
and October, 1989, in the southern Mojave Desert, Death Valley, and
the Lunar Crater Volcanic Field, Nevada. The purpose of these CD-ROMs
is to make available in a compact form through the Planetary Data
System (PDS) a collection of relevant data to conduct analyses in
preparation for the Earth Observing System (EOS), Mars Observer (MO),
and other missions. The generation of this set of CD-ROMs was
sponsored by the NASA Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program, the
Planetary Data System (PDS) and the Pilot Land Data System (PLDS).

This AAREADME.TXT file is one of the two nondirectory files located in
the top level directory of each CD-ROM volume in this collection. The
other file, VOLDESC.SFD, contains an overview of the data sets on
these CD-ROMs and is written in a format that is designed for access
by computers. These two files appear on every volume in the
collection. All other files on the CD-ROMs are located in directories
below the top level directory.

On Volume 1, the directory DOCUMENT contains a text file named
VOLINFO.TXT that describes the CD-ROM organization, the format and
content of each of the data sets, and background information and
references needed to understand the implementation of GRSFE and the
preparation of the data sets on the CD-ROMs. It is recommended that
you read the VOLINFO.TXT document before using the data files. The
DOCUMENT directory also includes text files that describe the format
of some of the data files. These text files are referenced in the
detached labels that accompany the data files. The directory INDEX,
also on Volume 1, contains a number of index files. These files are
tables in text form that have descriptive information about some of
the data sets on this CD-ROM. While the indexes can be visually
scanned, they have been designed so that they can also be loaded into
most database systems for fast and efficient searching.

Separate directories exist for each instrument that acquired data for
GRSFE. Each of these directories contains data set files and
associated detached labels. Some instrument directories are further
subdivided to manage a large number of files or to logically group a
collection of files. The ground-based data sets, documentation, index
tables and software are all located on Volume 1, and the airborne data
sets are spread over Volumes 1 through 9. The VOLINFO.TXT document
mentioned above contains a list of files and directories on each
volume.

On Volume 2, the SAMPLER directory contains a set of image files and
associated detached labels that illustrate the utility of comparison
of data from multiple sensors over the same sites. The images are sub-
scenes taken from AIRSAR, ASAS and TIMS images that appear elsewhere
in this CD-ROM collection. They are calibrated and registered to the
AVIRIS scene AVRLV02A.IMG, in the AVIRIS directory on the same volume.

Project URL: http://neespi.org/team/CLPNH_IPY.html
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=138

Rationale: The stability of the ecosystems in more than a half of Northern Eurasia and north North America (in Cold Land Regions, CLR) relies on the stability of seasonal snow cover and ice that, so far, holds these ecosystems together. Breach of this stability affects societies and economic activity in high latitudes. Currently, changes in terrestrial cryosphere are among the strongest contemporary environmental changes. However, these changes as well as their associated feedbacks and impacts are still inadequately described within the contemporary Earth System Models. During the 20th century, we observed snow cover and glaciers' retreat and permafrost thaw affecting water supply, land cover, and the carbon cycle. Glacier wastage has affected sea level rise, water freshening, sea ice reduction, bioproductivity changing, and redistributing gravity field patterns. Further consequences are difficult to predict. Paleodata, instrumental observations, and model simulations of future climate changes suggest significant and rapid changes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and land cover occur in high latitudes particularly over the CLR. It is critical to develop the ability to measure, monitor, and model the processes that will provide the possibility for accurate future projections of climatic and environmental changes in these regions because these changes have the potential to impact the Global Earth System and human society. We need (a) to understand how the changes in these regions affect regional and global biogeochemical, surface energy and water cycles, as well as human societies and how to develop the capability to predict changes to support global projections, informed decision making, and numerous applications in these regions; (b) to establish (restore, develop, utilize) an observational system to retrieve and properly interpret information about the current state and changes of the environment in the CLR; (c) assess their interactions with global climate and society; and (d) enhance the predictive capability of Earth System models to account for environmental changes over the Northern Hemisphere and the globe.

The overarching science question of this IPY activity is: How do terrestrial cryosphere dynamics in the Northern Hemisphere interact with and alter the biosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere of the Earth? 
The Science question dictates the following research strategy: We have to define first (a) what deficiencies currently exist in understanding the major processes in cold land regions? (b) what are the major sources of uncertainties? (c) what information is needed to run (and/or develop) sufficiently complete models that describe these processes? Thereafter, targeted field campaigns, data gathering /recovery, and/or new networks should be initiated. 

Within the triad: observations, process studies, and modeling, the role of Process Studies in Cold Land Regions is to improve models that reproduce the changes in the Earth System behavior in response to the changes in high latitudes. Currently existing models do not describe sufficiently well the critical processes of interactions and their dynamics within terrestrial ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, coastal zone, and cryosphere in CLR. Also, the initial state of some of components of the Earth System in the Regions (e.g., the cryosphere) is not yet well known. We need to justify both the innovative research and efforts to improve observations in the region that otherwise could be ineffective investments in old technology and practices. 

Three terrestrial components of the cryosphere in the CLR of the Northern Hemisphere: snow cover, permafrost, and small glaciers will be studied as well as their interactions with society and potential feedbacks to the Global Earth System. Within each area of research the foci of studies will be on (a) the models' development to improve understanding and projections of the dynamics of the Earth System in high latitudes and its interactions with the Global Earth System and (b) creation of conditions for seamless implementation of these models (e.g., organizing the input data stream for them) in a quest of answering the overarching science question and serving numerous practical applications. 

Tasks for snow cover studies. Major issues: (a) Global Earth System modeling and numerous applications require high resolution global snow water equivalent measurements, their extension in the past, and a proper physical description of processes describing snow dynamics; (b) Having a new Cold Land Processes Mission (CLPM) as a long-term objective, the IPY is the right time for extensive and focused groundwork to secure the Mission success. Tools: (a) Extensive field campaigns and network legacy to guaranty the CLPM calibration and ongoing support over the Hemisphere; (b) Studies of compatibility of various (in-situ and remote) instrumentation and data rescue efforts; (c) Development of a portable (scalable) physically based model of short-term and seasonal snow evolution applicable to rough terrain and/or in the presence of vegetation.

Tasks for permafrost studies. Major issue: Permafrost changes (warming and thawing) have global consequences these processes should be well understood, monitored, modeled, and projected. Mitigation strategies should be timely developed. Tools: (a) Establish and support a comprehensive permafrost monitoring system in the high latitudes including the Arctic coastal zone; (b) Develop reliable models accounting for changes in the permafrost and its interactions with terrestrial ecosystems, hydrology, atmosphere, and society and incorporate them into emerging global Earth System and reanalyses models; (c) Develop specialty models that seamlessly account for specifics of permafrost environment in practical applications (coastal erosion, cold land engineering, etc.) 

Tasks for glaciers' studies. Major issues: Increase in accuracy of monitoring of glaciers' dynamics from space and in situ observations to resolve the major uncertainties of the global glaciers' changes, first of all surface area and distribution versus elevation and surface mass balance with extrapolation from the observational network to the larger glacier systems. Tools: (a) Develop a conceptual model for areal generalization of the glaciers' characteristics and their monitoring; (b) Develop a portable model that describes the processes of glaciers' change in response to climate change; the model should be useable as a block in the regional and global climate models as well as for water and natural hazard management; (c) Repeat regular monitoring using laser altimetry for glaciers in CLR and blending these observations with existing long-term observational network data; (d) Assessment of direct anthropogenic impact on glaciers' dynamics (e.g., due to air pollution). Mostly small glaciers of the Northern Hemisphere will be studied within this IPY proposal.

Tasks for socio-economic studies. Major issue: Fragile environment and harsh climatic conditions in high latitudes put additional stress on societal sustainability during rapid environmental changes. Tools: (a) Determine the impacts of environmental changes in high latitudes on humans in particular on the indigenous population; (b) Develop models of economic effect, both positive and negative, of the ongoing and possible climate changes, snow- glaciers- and permafrost-related hazards; (c) Develop the societal feedback loop models for use in Global Earth models; (d) Develop mitigation strategies for the populations negatively affected by contemporary and projected environmental changes.

Tasks for integration studies. Major issue: Need for suite of regional models that incorporate peculiarities of interactions of climate, cryosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere of high latitudes and serve as a reliable internal block to Global Earth Models. Tools: (a) Develop regional models (e.g., reanalysis, WRF, LDAS) with specialty blocks (hydrology, cold land, coastal processes, ecosystem, societal interactions) incorporating major feedbacks that are specific for high latitudinal land areas and are of global importance (e.g., potentially powerful permafrost thawing over CLR and the Arctic coastal zone and greenhouse gases emission positive feedback); (b) Develop (improve) regional numerical weather forecast models to account for specifics of the high latitudes (including specific societal needs); (c) Verify Global Climate Models' projections in the high latitudes; (d) Organize input data stream (remote and in-situ) sufficient for operating the system that can answer the overarching science question and serve numerous practical applications.

This project is developing a processing system and data center to provide
operational ocean surface velocity fields from satellite altimeter and vector
wind data.

The regional focus will be the tropical Pacific, where we will demonstrate the
value for a variety of users, specifically fisheries management and
recruitment, monitoring debris drift, larvae drift, oil spills, fronts and
eddies, as well as on-going large scale ENSO monitoring, diagnostics and
prediction. We will encourage additional uses in search and rescue, naval and
maritime operations. The data will be subjected to extensive validation and
error analysis, and applied to various ocean, climate and dynamic basic
research problems. The user base derives from the NOAA CoastWatch and climate
prediction programs, the broad research community, the Navy's operational ocean
analysis program, and other civilian uses. The end product is to leave in place
a turnkey system running at NOAA/NESDIS, with an established user clientele and
easy internet data access.

The method to derive surface currents with satellite altimeter and
scatterometer data is the outcome of several years NASA sponsored research.

The proposed project will transition that capability to operational
oceanographic applications. The end product will be velocity maps updated
daily, with a goal for eventual 2-day maximum delay from time of satellite
measurement. Grid resolution will be 100 km for the basin scale, and finer
resolution in the vicinity of the Pacific Islands. The team consists of private
non-profit, educational and government partners with broad experience and
familiarity with the data, and the scientific and technical issues. Two
Partners are the original developers of the surface current derivation
techniques, and two are closely tied to satellite data sources and primary
processing centers. Others represent NOAA/NESDIS, Climate Prediction Center,
CoastWatch, NMFS and the Navy to evaluate uses and applications.

The changes to climate and environment in the Arctic are more rapid and profound than in most other regions on the Earth. These changes already have large impacts on the ecosystem and on the societies of those that live in the Arctic. Many of the changes appear on a pan-Arctic scale and are interrelated with the effects of human response to changes in the living conditions. This complex system of changes is poorly understood and to be able to properly respond and to develop sustainable mitigation and adaptation strategies, there is an urgent need to develop a deeper knowledge of the causes to these changes and the feedbacks in the entire system.

ISAC is a long-term, multidisciplinary program developed to study the effects of environmental changes on the circumpolar Arctic system and connections to the global system. ISAC includes the physical and chemical, biological and ecological as well socio-economic and cultural systems and concerns both effects due to the enhanced greenhouse warming and other anthropogenic activities, and the effects of the natural variability affecting the Arctic. ISAC will take a system approach to facilitate expansion and deepening of our knowledge of the arctic system and to document changes in the Arctic with respect to spatial and temporal patterns. ISAC will engage in observational, synthesis and modelling activities in response to societal and scientific needs and will provide the necessary scientific background for future impacts assessments.

ISAC is based on a science overview document and is developed by the International Science Committee (IASC) and the Arctic Ocean Science Board (AOSB). ISAC is governed by a Science Steering Group (SSG) and is advised by the ISAC Council. The ISAC International Secretariat is co-located with the IASC Secretariat.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ANDRILL (ANtarctic DRILLing) is an international program involving scientists from Germany, Italy, New Zealand, UK and USA designed to investigate Antarctica’s role in global environmental change from the recovery of rock and sediment cores from beneath the floating sea ice and ice shelves surrounding Antarctica. The planned program will use improved drilling technology that enables excellent recovery of deep (&gt;1000m) rock and sediment cores from the Antarctic margin. ANDRILL’s approach is to obtain specific reference records of key stratigraphic intervals proximal to the dynamic Antarctic cryosphere. While the ANDRILL program has already been many years in development, scientists and technical and logistical specialists from Germany, Italy, New Zealand and USA plan two major field campaigns for IPY 2007-2008: (1) Coring beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf, where the target is a 1200 m-thick body of sediments deposited in a crustal depression that resulted from the loading of Ross Island volcanoes. The cores should yield a high-resolution record of the past few million years of ice shelf response to past interglacial warm extremes, including its role in modulation of the global oceanic conveyor, and potential vulnerability from present global warming; (2) Coring in southern McMurdo Sound where the target is middle to upper Miocene strata. The cores should allow the testing of interpretations derived from global proxy records implying a change from a warm climatic optimum ~17 Ma to the onset of major cooling ~14 Ma and the formation of a quasi-permanent ice sheet on Antarctica. During IPY 2007-2008, ANDRILL will also continue geophysical and site surveys, and planning for future drilling in McMurdo Sound and around the Antarctic continental margin. Results of these activities will provide key insights into: (A) The development and behaviour of the Antarctic cryospheric system (ice sheet, ice shelf, and sea-ice) and the magnitude and frequency of its change on centennial to millennial time scales; (B) The evolution of and timing of major tectonic episodes in Antarctic and the stratigraphic development of sedimentary basins, and; (C) The influence of Antarctic ice sheets on Cenozoic climate, the modulation of themohaline ocean circulation, and eustatic sea level change. The planned program will bring together a team of international scientists, educators and students who will work in Antarctica during the initial characterisation of cores and then in a series of workshops and meetings designed to integrate specialised investigations carried out at home laboratories following return of the cores from Antarctica.

      TUNU*-MAFIG (2003-2009; p.t. 10 nations and about 35 scientist
and research students) brings focus to the diversity and physiological
adaptations of the Arctic marine fish fauna. Arctic fishes are
relatively poorly studied and comparisons with the Antarctic fish
fauna will be of particular interest in the light of the peculiar
evolutionary history and geological time scales that characterize the
two polar regions (cf. IPY-activities EBA, ID: 137 and ICEFISH, ID:
93). Warming trends have been reported for Arctic waters in general
and the fjords of NE Greenland in particular. The sea ice cover has
been significantly reduced in NE Greenland during the past three
decades and this makes the area a timely Arctic key site to study
effects of climate change on the marine biota. Fishes are known to be
particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and salinity. Arctic
fishes are physiologically adapted to subzero temperatures and live
within a narrow thermal zone (~ 2 °C). Therefore, even a slight
increase in temperature, and a concomitant reduction in salinity, may
have profound effects on the diversity and physiological performance
of Arctic fishes. As such, the NE Greenland fish fauna is deemed to be
an excellent bio-indicator of rapid changes in the Arctic marine
environment.

      The scientific framework includes: 1) Examination of the
diversity and physiological adaptations of marine fishes at selected
sites along the NE Greenland coast, i.e. between Danmarkshavn (77°N)
and Scoresby Sund Fjord (70°N), and from the innermost part of the
fjords to the continental slope. 2) Sampling of basic hydrographical
and topographical data at the same sites, incl. the use of permanent
CTD-loggers and multi-beam sonar. 3) Repetition of investigations at
key sites to obtain long-term data on possible inter-annual changes in
fish diversity and hydrographical regimes. 4) Establishment of a
museum collection of marine fishes encountered during the expeditions.

      The logistical backbone of TUNU-MAFIG consists of four
expeditions to NE Greenland headed by the University of Tromsø. Two
expeditions were conducted successfully in autumn 2003 (TUNU-I) and
2005 (TUNU-II) with the ice strengthened R/V Jan Mayen as the
operational base. The TUNU-III and -IV expeditions are planned to take
place in autumn 2007 and 2008. (*TUNU = East Greenland in the modern
Greenlandic language)

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Program Announcement:

NOAA invites interested institutions to submit letters of
intent indicating interest in establishing a cooperative
agreement with NOAA to participate in a multinational network of
Research Centers within the proposed Seasonal to Interannual
Climate Prediction Program (SCPP).  The proposal to establish an
end-to-end, multinational SCPP is based on the evolution of
existing program efforts to observe, understand, predict, and
assess the ocean and the atmosphere. The programmatic strength
of these efforts has been derived from the support of individual
federal agencies working together within the context of the
U.S. Global Change Research Program (GCRP). These interrelated
efforts provide the foundation which has enabled the research
community to provide useful predictions of climate variability
on seasonal to interannual time scales and are each a component
of a comprehensive Program.  The U.S. proposes to initiate a
multinational planning process intended to lead to the
establishment of the multinational infrastructure needed to
generate and transfer useful climate information and
forecasts. This Announcement of Opportunity is intended to
result in the establishment of NOAA-designated Research Centers
to pursue the development of ENSO forecast techniques in
anticipation of the full multinational structure which will
evolve for SCPP. NOAA intends to ask one or a group of such
Centers selected through this announcement to assume specific
responsibilities for establishing a center to prepare and
disseminate regularly an experimental forecast to all interested
countries. Recognizing the value of El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) forecasting to countries throughout the world, this
center is referred to as the International Research Institute
(IRI) in the U.S. proposal to establish a
Seasonal-to-Interannual Climate Prediction Program. This action
on the part of U.S. will represent the first step in the process
of initializing the participation of all interested countries,
and therefore NOAA wishes to emphasize that extensive
multinational consultation will be an integral part of the
process leading to a U.S. site for an International Research
Institute for SCPP.  Funding for activities supported under this
announcement will be provided through the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate and Global Change
Program administered by the NOAA Office of Global Programs.

The Northern California Circulation Study (NCCCS), supported by
the Minerals Management Service, is a 5-year physical
oceanography program to describe the circulation on the
continental shelf and upper slope between San Francisco and the
Oregon border.  This study will result in an improved
description and understanding od circulation features,
particularly near-surface currents.  The general objectives of
the NCCCS are:

-- To obtain high-quality direct and indirect measurements of
currents on the shelf and upper slope, with adequate temporal
and spatial resolution to describe the pricipal advective
processes.

-- To describe the circulation in statistical terms, including
mean current patterns, seasonal and shorter-term variability,
vertical structure, and response to forcing.

-- To characterize the circulation in terms of dynamic
processes.  For each process, such as wind forcing, an
assessment of the primary driving force, response sensitivity,
spatial pattern, momentum balance, and advective displacement
scale is required.  (Bruce A. Magnell, EG&amp;G Geos)

Scientific Objectives:
Since October 1984, the SAGE II instrument has been flying aboard the
Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) collecting data that are being
processed and archived at NASA LaRC to produce four Level 2 data
products: aerosol extinction profiles at 1020, 525, 453, and 385
nanometers, and ozone, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide mixing ratio
profiles.  These products are nearly global in coverage, with data
spanning from 80 degrees North to 80 degrees South latitudes.
The accuracy of these data was verified by extensive validation
efforts and the data sets are now archived and available for general
scientific use. These data may be of use to investigators who are
interested in spatial and temporal variations of ozone, aerosols,
water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide caused by seasonal and short-term
meteorological variations, atmospheric chemistry and microphysics, and
transient phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions.  These data may also
be of some benefit for those who perform upper tropospheric studies of
aerosols or who perform climatology studies of cirrus clouds. SAM II,
SAGE I, and SAGE II have provided data sets that are now available for
use and provide a span of aerosol data from late 1978 up through the
present time.
Project Description:
The SAGE II instrument is a seven-channel Sun photometer using a
Cassegrainian-configured telescope, holographic grating, and seven
silicon photodiodes, some with interference filters, to define the
seven spectral channel bandpasses. Solar radiation is reflected off a
pitch mirror into the telescope with an image of the Sun formed at the
focal plane. The instrument's instantaneous field-of-view, defined by
an aperture in the focal plane, is a 1/2 X 2-1/2 arc-minute slit that
produces a vertical resolution at the tangent point on the earth's
horizon of about 0.5 kilometers.  Radiation passing through the
aperture is transferred to the spectrometer section of the instrument
containing the holographic grating and seven separate detector
systems. The holographic grating disperses the incoming radiation into
the various spectral regions centered at the 1020, 940, 600, 525, 453,
448, and 385 nanometer wavelengths. Slits on the Rowland circle of the
grating define the spectral bandpass of the seven spectral
channels. The spectrometer system is inside the azimuth gimbal to
allow the instrument to be pointed at the Sun without image
rotation. The azimuth gimbal can be rotated over 370 degrees so that
measurements can be made at any azimuth angle.
The operation of the instrument during each sunrise and sunset
measurement is totally automatic. Prior to each sunrise or sunset
encounter, the instrument is rotated in azimuth to its predicted solar
acquisition position. When the Sun's intensity reaches a level of one
percent of maximum in the Sun sensor, the instrument adjusts its
azimuth position to lock onto the radiometric center of the Sun to
within +/-45 arc-seconds and then begins acquisition of the Sun by
rotating its pitch mirror in a predetermined direction depending on
whether it is a sunrise or a sunset. When the Sun is acquired, the
pitch mirror rotates back and forth across the Sun at a rate of about
15 arc-minutes per second. The radiometric channel data are sampled at
a rate of 64 samples per second per channel, digitized to 12-bit
resolution, and recorded for later transmission back to Earth.
The SAGE II experiment is ongoing.  The Langley DAAC continues to
archive these data.
Data Used and Produced:
The SAGE II science and engineering data, along with spacecraft time,
position, and housekeeping data, are stored aboard the spacecraft and
downlinked to NASA GSFC through a ground station. GSFC then forwards
these data to LaRC for processing and scientific analysis. GSFC also
sends spacecraft and solar ephemeris data to LaRC. These data are the
input to the inversion process which is explained in the next
section. At the completion of the data processing, four Level 2 SAGE
II products are produced: aerosol extinction profiles, ozone
concentration profiles, water vapor profiles, and nitrogen dioxide
profiles.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=293

Using a unique Canadian technology, the ASTAPA system will supplement existing and planned ocean observing systems with the capacity to monitor passages of rare and commercially important animals for up to 20 years and will also extend the reach of physical monitoring systems. The original concept of an Arctic Curtain&amp; (EOI 640, Canada ) to monitor seasonal migrations of fish, expanded through the IPY process and a global proposal to the Canadian Foundation of Innovation for an Ocean Shelf Tracking and Physic Array (OSTAPA). The original EOI for a single line of acoustic receivers through the narrowest channels in the Canadian Archipelago drew interest from marine mammal trackers and ocean observers from the Bering Strait to Norway. So, ASTAPA now includes multiple lines to record direction and speed of travel as well as local oceanographics at key passages. ASTAPA would have the proven data gathering and management capacity of the operational Census of Marine Life (COML) Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project (www.postcoml.org) to tag animals as small as 20g with individually unique acoustic codes and to follow larger tags for up to 20 years.
The Arctic is a more challenging environment, but the POST personnel with technical experience will work with DFO colleagues to develop the logistics for putting the system in place. A consortium would be developed to maintain receiver lines. VR3 receivers, produced by Canadian manufacturer, VEMCO-AMIRIX, allow frequent data recovery for up to seven years simply by putting a hydrophone modem connection in the water. In the Arctic this can be done throughout the winter through an ice hole, and in summer from small boats. Individual receivers record the presence of a tag within a kilometer, so tagged animal movements in open water or under ice can be tracked. Also, VR3s have sensors to measure, store and download physical data via modem, so there is strong synergy and potential savings between physics and biology. As with POST, most tagging would be done by other researchers and consortia. We have identified a broad range of projects interested in the data ASTAPA can return. There are two ways that ASTAPA complements the many projects tagging animals with satellite tags: (1) acoustic tags implanted at the same time provide a unique identifier for up to 20 years, so that changes in individual animal behaviour can be correlated with climate change and (2) data recovery is controlled locally by local people and does not depend on remote multi-billion dollar satellite networks. Planned future developments will add download capacity to VR3 receivers so that data stored in archival tags can be transferred acoustically to receivers instead of by radio to satellites, greatly reducing data costs. 
ASTAPA complements several of the other IPY EOIs. For example EOI 624 AMBER examines fish distributions, density and reaction to climate change. Much of the field work for this project will be centered in the waterways around Resolute. ASTAPA proposes the installation of an acoustic curtain in this area. The logistical crossover between the two projects will be high. Also, our monitoring of animal movement and the characteristics of the water column will complement AMBER, just as their information of fish fauna composition, density and distribution will complement ASTAPA. Also, EOI 713 Canadian Arctic CoML will provide information on biodiversity that will be valuable in completing the picture of multi species interactions that we observe by animal tracking. Logistical cross-over includes at the least ship time on the CCGS Amundsen. EOI's 663 GWAMM, 77 and 153 MEOP will provide information on the physical attributes of the water column profiled by tagged marine mammals, including information from areas under ice. We will also have similar information. Ship gathered CTD's by these projects will also increase our knowledge of physical variables of the water column as our static lines provide the same information at key points. Also, logistics of equipment movement and animal tagging can be coordinated to reduce effort and cost and maximize results. EOI's 688 COME and 673 Canadian Icebreaker provide transport to remote locations for installation and downloading of acoustic curtain data. While EOI's 682 Freshwater Flux in Canadian Arctic, 80 and 14 IAOOS will provide much needed information on the movement and characteristics of waters throughout the Arctic Archipelago.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition 24</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The SCAR GIANT programme is reponsible to establish and maintain a high precision geodetic infrastructure for Antarctica. It operates a range of geodesy projects. Details on these can be found in the current GIANT work programme.

There has been considerable international cooperation in Antarctic Geodesy since SCAR was formed in 1958. The Geodetic Infrastructure for Antarctica (GIANT) program was identified in the SCAR 1992 meeting and has evolved as the coordinating program for all SCAR Antarctic geodesy.

Antarctica is important in the context of global geodesy. In the past global models have heavily relied on observations from Northern Hemisphere sites and the results do not always fit in the Southern Hemisphere or represent the best global picture. Antarctic space geodetic observatories have provided data to rectify this imbalance.

With advent of man made satellites Geodesy has advanced significantly linking isolated geodetic networks and monitoring tectonic motion. A number of permanent GPS receivers have been installed in Antarctica and data is increasingly being retrieved by satellite transmission from these sites.

This fiducial network of GPS points, augmented by VLBI and other techniques, forms the basis for an integrated geodetic infrastructure as the basis for all scientific spatial data. Data from these sites in Antarctica are of ongoing importance to global geodesy, especially in the determinations of precise orbits and the integration of different observational techniques. These sites provide a stable platform for combining summer epoch campaigns, densifying the ITRF network across Antarctica.

Plume Model Validation and Development Study
The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) undertook a significant
experimental and analytic project to evaluate atmospheric dispersion
models currently applied to electric generating facilities and to
provide data bases for developing improved plume models.  This
project, the Plume Model Validation and Development (PMV&amp;D) project,
comprises four studies of plumes in different environmental settings.
The initial phase of the PMV&amp;D project examined plume dispersion
behavior in relatively uncomplicated terrain.  Field measurement
programs were conducted in the vicinity of the Kincaid Generating
Station in central Illinois, which is located in smooth, level
terrain.  The measurement programs included nine months of continuous
monitoring of air quality, meteorological, and power plant emission
variables, supplemented by three three-week periods of intensive,
specialized measurements of plume dispersion.
The second phase of the PMV&amp;D project investigated plume behavior in
moderately complex terrain.  Field measurement programs were carried
out in the vicinity of the Bull Run steam plant, situated 20 km west
of Knoxville and 8 km east of Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  The field
programs at this site included two four-week periods of intensive,
specialized measurements of plume dispersion.
The behavior of plumes in complex terrain was studied during a third
phase in a joint effort with EPA at the Sierra Pacific Power Company's
Tracy plant, 20 km east of Reno, Nevada along the Truckee River.  A
preliminary experiment was conducted at the site over a four-week
period, including two weeks of intensive measurements of plume
behavior.  This study laid the groundwork for the design of EPA's Full
Scale Plume Study (FSPS) at that site.  EPRI supported both programs
by supplying airborne lidar sampling of the power plant plume.
Finally, the fourth phase of the PMV&amp;D Project was a study conducted
at the Perry-K Steam Station of Indianapolis (Indiana) Power and Light
Company to investigate plume behavior in an urban environment.  The
plant is located about 1 km from the urban center of Indianapolis.
The field program included four weeks of intensive measurements of
plume dispersion and an additional week for a collocation experiment.

problems associated with aircraft, SPECTRE was designed to be a
surface-based program.

The SPECTRE was a tightly coordinated team effort funded by two
umbrella proposals (one to DOE, one to NASA) assembled by the
authors. Highly experienced subteams carried out the three main
functions: spectrometer, remote, and in situ measurements.

Chosen spectrometers:

a large wavelength range (3-18 ?m);
high spectral resolution (1 cm-1 or better)
cryogenic cooling of the detectors; and

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The GES-DISC Interactive Online Visualization and Analysis Infrastructure (Giovanni) is the underlying infrastructure for a growing family of Web interfaces that allows users to analyze gridded data interactively online without having to download any data. Through Giovanni, users are invited to discover and explore our data using sophisticated analyses and ... visualizations.

In the future, there will be more instances of Giovanni available and we encourage your feedback! Features of Giovanni

Current features of Giovanni include:

-Access to data from multiple remote sites as well as local sites.
-Server-side temporal and spatial subsetting.
-Server-side processing.
-Support for multiple data formats including Hierarchical Data Format (HDF),
HDF-EOS, network Common Data Form (netCDF), GRIdded Binary (GRIB), and binary.
-Support for multiple plot types including area, time, Hovmoller, and image
animation.
-Support for outputting data in ASCII format in multiple resolutions.
-Parameter intercomparisons
-Easily configurable to support customized portals for measurements-based
projects or disciplines.

Giovanni supports many plot types as well as ASCII output of results.

Goals of Giovanni

The principal design goal for Giovanni was to provide a quick and simple interactive means for science data users to study various phenomena by trying various combinations of parameters measured by different instruments, arrive at a conclusion, and then generate graphs suitable for a publication. Alternatively, Giovanni would provide a means to ask relevant what-if questions and get back answers that would stimulate further investigations. This would all be done without having to download and preprocess large amounts of data. A secondary design goal was for Giovanni to be easily configurable, extensible, and portable. The GES DISC currently runs Giovanni on Linux, SGI, and Sun platforms.

Another goal of Giovanni was to off-load as much as possible the data processing workload onto the machines hosting the data and to reduce data transfers to a minimum. Given the enormous amount of HDF data at the GES DISC Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), it was a requirement that Giovanni support HDF, HDF-EOS, as well as binary.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The First ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project) Field Experiment (FIFE) was a large-scale climatology project conducted on the Konza Prairie in Kansas from 1987 through 1989.

The general objectives of FIFE were to:

    * improve understanding of carbon and water cycles
    * coordinate data collected by satellites, aircraft, and ground instruments
    * use satellites to measure carbon and water cycles

To achieve these objectives, the FIFE team focused on:

    * understanding the biophysical processes controlling the fluxes of exchanges of radiation, moisture, and carbon   dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere
    * developing and testing remote-sensing methodologies for observing these processes at a pixel level
    * understanding how to scale the pixel-level information to regional scales commensurate with modeling of global processes

The FIFE data archive includes background and historical data from as early as 1858. Extensive analysis of the remote-sensing data and modeling of the FIFE data were performed in the years between the publication of the first (1992) and second (1996) special FIFE issues in the Journal of Geophysical Research.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The CABRILLO Project (Southern CAlifornia Bight Regional Investigations Life, Land, and Ocean) of the U.S. Geological Survey addresses complex oceanographic and hazard issues that affect Southern California coastal communities.

The offshore area is geologically active resulting in the potential for earthquakes, underwater mass-wasting events (submarine landslides and slumps), and tsunamis. The geology of the seafloor along the coast and continental shelf of Southern California provides diverse habitats that include rich fisheries, kelp forests, marine mammals, and many other niches and biological guilds. Both human and non-human inhabitants are at risk from pollution of the coastal ocean and from the degradation of fresh-water sources as a result of salt-water intrusion. In addition, the coastal ocean is a resource for economic development (shipping), communication (trans-oceanic cables), fishing, recreation, and tourism. The CABRILLO project provides USGS scientists with an interdisciplinary framework in which these complex coastal issues can be studied.

CABRILLO efforts currently focus on six component tasks and a regional synthesis:

    * CASA - Salt Water Intrusion investigates offshore-onshore components of salt-water intrusion into coastal aquifers by developing 2D and 3D stratigraphic models of potential salt-water infiltration.
    * Océano - Contaminant Processes studies ocean contaminants, their distribution along the coastal region and the processes by which they are transported.
    * Playa - Coastal Change addresses issues of coastal change, including beach loss, shoreline retreat, and the processes that impact coastal stability.
    * Tierra - Geologic Hazards investigates geologic hazards associated with submarine landslides, earthquakes, and tsunamis.
    * Vida - Benthic Habitats concerns the relationship between sea-floor rock and sediment and benthic habitats.
    * Región - Regional Synthesis provides a regional synthesis of Southern California's coastal and marine geology, the impact of man on the environment and the impact of the natural environment on man.

It aims to provide a high-quality subset of marine meteorological data, with extensive associated metadata, to be available in both real-time and delayed mode to support global climate studies.

VOSClim is a follow-up to the earlier VOS Special Observing Project North Atlantic (VSOP-NA) which was conducted on behalf of the World Climate Research Project (WCRP) from 1988 to 1990.

Data from the project will be invaluable for climate change studies and research. In particular it will be used to:

    -input directly into air-sea flux computations, as part of coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models;
    -provide ground truth for calibrating satellite observations;
    -provide a high quality reference data set for possible re-calibration of observations from the entire VOS fleet.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A global study of the biogeography of deep-water chemosynthetic ecosystems and the processes that drive them.

Background
Directed from the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS) in the UK, the Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM-CSIC), in Barcelona, Spain, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in the US, ChEss is improving our knowledge of the biodiversity and biogeography of species from deep-water chemosynthetically-driven ecosystems at a global scale and increasing our understanding of the processes that shape these communities. In order to achieve such ambitious goals, scientists from around the globe have been brought together under the ChEss umbrella to coordinate their activities focusing on ChEss scientific objectives. ChEss is addressing the main questions of CoML on diversity, abundance and distribution of marine species, within the realm of deep-water reducing environments such as hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, whale falls, sunken wood and areas of low oxygen that intersect with continental margins and seamounts. It is crucial to combine results from research on all these systems in order to understand the phylogeographic relationships amongst all deep-water chemosynthetic ecosystems.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The NeMO Project was conceived as a long-term study of the
interactions between geology, chemistry, and biology on a dynamic part
of the mid-ocean ridge system, using state-of the art technology. The
goal is to make multiple observations at one location over several
years to document changes in interrelated systems. Hence, the need for
a multi-year seafloor observatory.

The site chosen for this observatory effort is called "Axial
Seamount". Axial is an active volcano located on the Juan de Fuca
Ridge, about 250 miles off the coast of Oregon and Washington. The
Juan de Fuca Ridge is a boundary where two of the Earth's tectonic
plates move slowly, but episodically, apart. When the plates move, the
process is accompanied by small earthquakes and, at some times, by
magma intrusions and volcanic eruptions.Axial volcano is seamount at
460N, 1300W, at the intersection of the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the
Cobb seamount chain. It rises 1100 m above the surrounding ocean floor
to a minimum depth of 1400 m below sea level. The Axial volcano was
chosen for the NeMO Project because it is the most volcanically active
site on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.

The NeMO Project also is an opportunity to share this exciting
scientific research with teachers, students, and the general
public. The NeMO cruise will have a teacher at sea this summer and
another teacher working onshore to help make research results
available via the web. Daily updates are planned for the
calendar page describing life at sea and scientific results during the
expedition as well as answers to your questions during the cruise.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment, a multi-institutional effort managed by NASA Ames with participation by Ames scientists, was a major airborne campaign conducted during August and September of 1987 to study the sudden and unanticipated decrease observed in the abundance of ozone over Antarctica in the Austral spring since 1979. Specially instrumented NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft were used to acquire a database on the chemical, meteorological and cloud-physical parameters associated with the phenomenon. The aircraft experiments were coupled with data from three separate satellite systems and ground based sensors located in various places on Antarctica. The collection of data from all experiments was the result of international collaboration and represents the most massive data acquisition ever performed over the Antarctic region.
      
The instrumentation used to acquire the airborne data was developed under long-standing programs funded by the Upper Atmospheric Research and Tropospheric Chemistry offices of NASA's Earth Science and Applications Division. Results of the mission were presented at a Polar Ozone Symposium in Snowmass, Colorado in May of 1988. A two volume special issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research devoted to this experimental effort was published in August and November of 1989. The data obtained during the Antarctic mission show the lowest ozone levels ever recorded and directly implicate man-made chemical compounds, chlorofluorocarbons, in the enormous ozone loss over this remote region in the southern hemisphere.
      
One of the most compelling pieces of evidence leading to this conclusion is shown in the chart . These data, measured on the ER-2 aircraft as it flew south from Chile into the ozone hole, show the dramatic inverse correlation between ozone and chlorine monoxide. Because chlorine monoxide is produced by the process in which manmade chlorine destroys ozone, the large quantities observed provide strong evidence that manmade chemicals are involved in the Antarctic ozone loss process.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Rapid Climate Change (RAPID) is a £20 million, six-year (2001-2007) programme of the Natural Environment Research Council. The programme aims to improve our ability to quantify the probability and magnitude of future rapid change in climate, with a main (but not exclusive) focus on the role of the Atlantic Ocean&amp;#039;s Thermohaline Circulation. 

The specific scientific objectives of the RAPID programme were agreed by the Rapid Climate Change Steering Committee and are detailed in the RAPID Science Plan. 

Approximately £11M have been awarded to proposals that were submitted in response to the RAPID First round of funding . About £5M of this commitment is to design a system to continuously monitor the strength and structure of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. This design effort is being matched by comparative funding from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) for collaborative projects reviewed jointly with the NERC proposals. 

The RAPID programme has now completed a 2nd and last round of funding, with two parallel Announcements of Opportunity. A total of 5 bids were funded under the Joint International AO , with the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and the Research Council of Norway, and 11 bids under the RAPID 2nd &amp;Science&amp; AO.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Hydrographic/ADCP surveys, satellite imagery, and surface drifters have all served to revise our view of the coastal upwelling that occurs seasonally in most eastern boundary regions, such as off the coast of California. Instead of a uniform upwelling along the coast, with an offshore Ekman flow at the surface and a return flow at depth, we now have a view that much of the transport occurs as "squirts and jets" -- upwelling centers associated with capes and promontories, offshore transport in intense jets, and a vigorous field of mesoscale eddies.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Tagging of Pacific Predators</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A program using electronic tagging technologies to study migration patterns of large open-ocean animals and the oceanographic factors controlling these patterns.

Although humans have pursued pelagic animals for hundreds - indeed thousands - of years, our understanding of their complex lives remains fragmentary. Historically, the tools available to study animals and their ocean environment have provided only a "snapshot" view of their lives. Recent technological advances, however, are revolutionizing such studies and will soon provide near-real time, narrative "motion picture" visualizations of these animals' lives.

The Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP) research program is a collaboration among scientists from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Mexico, Japan, France and the UK, that will apply new technologies to understanding the environmental basis for movements and behaviors of large pelagic animals in the North Pacific. With new electronic tags, TOPP scientists will follow the migrations of marine fishes, turtles, birds, pinnipeds, whales and Humboldt squid as they crisscross the Pacific basin. The results will answer basic questions about the animals' biology including where they feed and breed, and what migration corridors they use. By integrating these biological data with available oceanographic information, scientists can also begin to explore how the dynamic ocean environment influences these basic life functions. By tagging a broad array of taxonomically diverse species, the scientists will gain a broader understanding of how the North Pacific ecosystem functions.

In addition to providing information about the animals themselves, the data from the tags are invaluable to oceanographers. Although modern oceanographic sciences are aided by satellite-based observations, this view from space can only provide information about the oceans' surface. There is a dearth of information about the water column. This lack of data limits scientists' ability to describe ocean dynamics, and has hampered efforts to understand the coupling between the ocean, atmosphere and climate Understanding of this coupling is a critical component of models that predict changes in the global climate Since many of the TOPP organisms make repeated dives as they travel, they are continually sampling the water column-effectively "profiling" the ocean along their path.

The goals of the TOPP program, to obtain both biological and oceanographic information for an array of species, require the development of new tools. Additional tags are being designed that will expand the range of oceanographic parameters that can be measured. Also, the tracking the movements of thousands of individuals require new software for the assimilation, storage, analysis and visualization of 3-D organismal and oceanographic data as it varies through time. The TOPP team is working with experts in computer sciences, oceanographic modeling, and data visualization to develop these tools.

The TOPP program will provide a more complete understanding about how large open-ocean animals utilize the North Pacific ecosystem as well as about the North Pacific itself. We will know which areas are most critical for feeding, reproduction and migration and better understand the environmental mechanisms that shape these behaviors. This information will both add to our current knowledge about these magnificent creatures, and will be invaluable in establishing ecosystem-based management strategies to ensure the long-term health of populations.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">IPY Data and Information Service for Distributed Data Management</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: IPY DIS
Project URL: http://nsidc.org/ipydis/status.html
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=49

The WDC for Glaciology, Boulder and the Electronic Geophysical Year (eGY) in collaboration with many others propose to host the IPY DIS described in the IPY Framework Document. The DIS will work closely with the Data Policy and Management Sub-Committee (Data Committee) and other data management bodies and observing networks to develop the IPY data and information policy and strategy. The DIS will then be the primary implementer of that strategy and policy recognizing that the strategy will need to evolve with the science needs and developments of IPY.

Although much will depend on the strategy that is developed, we envision the DIS as an overall data management consultant and coordinator and a central data portal for an internationally distributed data management system. The DIS will continue to establish close partnerships with data centers and organizations around the world to build on existing systems. We will also work with each specific IPY cluster to ensure appropriate centralized data description and distributed archiving. Regional or discipline-specific affinity centers coordinated by the DIS will facilitate appropriate data description and archive. For example the Frozen Ground Data Center at the WDC, Boulder is working closely with the permafrost cluster, while the proposed Arctic Peoples Observations Center (EoI 358) could coordinate community-based monitoring data. Other potential affinity centers based on our current partners could include Russian data, Chinese data, data for education and outreach, remote sensing data, geospatial data infrastructures (regional and global), paleoenvironmental data, marine biological data, bibliographic data, and others (a detailed spreadsheet is available on request). Many of these affinity centers will likely create their own means of access to the data. It is unrealistic for a central DIS to be the single or even primary means of access, but we would like to establish a means to automatically share metadata across the system through a common (perhaps XML-based) framework

Specific activities of the DIS could include:
-Collection (automated, where possible) of catalog metadata for all IPY projects and provision of Web-based portals to all IPY data archived around the world.
-Examination and implementation of data discovery tools and data presentation schemes such as an interoperable web-based map server to enhance data access through a Web portal (could include a locator map for all IPY projects). 
-Identification of existing tools to facilitate data management, and build on those to meet the needs of the IPY community. For example, the Global Change Master Directory's (GCMD) metadata authoring tool, docBuilder, could be customized.
-Serving as a focal point for cross-disciplinary data integration, especially across the natural and social sciences.
-Creation of appropriate management tools for non-numerical data such as interview transcripts, photographs, and videotapes.
-Collaboration with eGY to make data management best practices and principles available to researchers and agencies, via Web pages, workshops, and other channels.
-Acting as a clearinghouse and facilitator for data management and integration issues that need research, discussion, and resolution.
-Working with eGY to increase awareness of the value of data management for both numerical and non-numerical data.
-Responsive service to the IPY research community regarding data management

The DIS will take advantage of existing data management infrastructures, organizations, and technologies such as National and World Data Centers, the Joint Committee for Antarctic Data Management (JCADM), the GCMD, virtual observatories, and the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure. This distributed system will allow for appropriate management of the various types of data including social science and physical science data, and analog collections. The distributed nature of the system will also encourage development of new and experimental data access methods, including data mining technology and innovative data presentation methods that facilitate data integration. 

It is essential, however, to ensure ready and equitable access to and effective long-term preservation of the data. The DIS will assist distributed archives in adhering to sound data management principles and best practices as defined by the Data Committee, eGY, CODATA, WCRP CliC, JCADM, our partners, and other entities. We will ensure that these principles build upon existing international standards such the Open Archival Information System Reference Model and the ISO19115 metadata standard. The DIS will take advantage of emerging shared resources in the geosciences community, such as the effort to develop an international geophysical sample number (IGSN). In addition, the DIS could assist data providers in addressing human subjects protections and confidentiality issues for social science data and for other types of geo-referenced data.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP) is an international effort to identify systematic errors in Arctic Ocean models under realistic forcing.
      
      
The main goals of the research are to examine the ability of Arctic Ocean models to simulate variability on seasonal to interannual scales, and to qualitatively and quantitatively understand the behaviour of different Arctic Ocean models. AOMIP's major objective is to use a suite of sophisticated models to simulate the Arctic Ocean circulation for the periods 1948-2002 and 1901-2002. Forcing will use the observed climatology and the daily atmospheric pressure and air temperature fields. Model results will be contrasted and compared to understand model strengths and weaknesses.
      
AOMIP will bring together the international modeling community for a comprehensive evaluation and validation of current Arctic Ocean models. The project will provide valuable information on improving Arctic Ocean models and will result in a better understanding of the processes that maintain the Arctic's observed variability.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The purpose of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS)
Project is to provide quantitative data on global ocean bio-optical
properties to the Earth science community. Subtle changes in ocean
color signify various types and quantities of marine phytoplankton
(microscopic marine plants), the knowledge of which has both
scientific and practical applications. The SeaWiFS Project operates a
research data system that processes, calibrates, validates, archives
and distributes data received from SeaWiFS. The SeaWiFS Mission is a
part of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise.

The SeaStar spacecraft, developed by OSC, carries the SeaWiFS
instrument and was launched to low Earth orbit on board an extended
Pegasus launch vehicle on August 1, 1997.

The SeaWiFS data is procured as a "data buy" from a private
contractor, Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), which subcontracted
with the Hughes Santa Barbara Research Center (SBRC) as the builder of
the SeaWiFS ocean color sensor. OSC built, launched, and operates the
SeaStar satellite carrying the sensor.

The GSFC EOS DAAC has the responsibility for the permanent archiving
and distribution of SeaWiFS data to all approved SeaWiFS data
users. The SDPS provides processed data to the GSFC DAAC. Authorized
users may also request LAC data archived at NASA-licensed HRPT
stations. A consolidated, on-line, electronic catalog of all holdings
of SeaWiFS data at Goddard or NASA-licensed HRPT stations is available
to all authorized SeaWiFS research users. Requests for data not held
by the GSFC DAAC will be directed to the LAC station that holds the
data. Fees, if any, for copies of SeaWiFS data can be no higher than
the nominal cost of reproduction of the requested data. The EOS DAAC
will support the distribution of data in its holdings through
electronic means and on selected magnetic or optical media. Standing
orders for routine distribution of all or selected products, as they
become available, are subject to approval by NASA.

The polar regions sensitivity to climate change makes them an ideal early warning system. But an early warning system can only function if scientists can continually monitor the world's oceans and develop better models. A Global Climate Observing System was set up by the United Nations in 1992, but major gaps exist at high latitudes because the harsh environmental conditions make gathering this data very difficult. iAOOS - a project involving a dozen countries, including the UK, USA, Russia and China - will help plug this gap by setting up a long-term ocean monitoring system in the Arctic. This kind of project is impossible without huge international cooperation and is an example of the vitally-important global science that IPY is producing.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">National Estuarine Inventory</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The National Estuarine Inventory is administered by ORCA's Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) Division.  In addition to the assessment
activities  identified in the profiles that follow, the NEI is supported by the
National Coastal  Wetlands Inventory, the Estuarine Living Marine Resources
Program, the National  Shellfish Register, the Coastal and Ocean Resource
Economics Program, the Coastal   Development Trends Series, and the National
Coastal Pollution Discharge Inventory.   These projects and associated data
holdings are described elsewhere in this report.
The National Estuarine Inventory is a series of inter-related activities that
define, characterize, and assess the Nation's estuarine systems.  The goal of
the NEI  is to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the health and
status of the  Nation's estuaries and to bring estuaries into focus as a
national resource base.  NEI  data are compiled in a systematic and consistent
manner that enables the Nation's  estuaries to be compared and assessed
according to their environmental quality,  economic values, and resource uses.
The main holdings of the NEI project are described by the data set entries
keyed to Campaign/Project NEI. This is supplemented by the following summaries
of four databases:
o Physical and Hydrologic Characteristics of Estuaries
o Estuarine Land-Use Categories
o Susceptibility of Estuaries to Nutrient Related Pollution
o The National Estuarine Eutrophication Project
Physical and Hydrologic Characteristics
A principal feature of the NEI is the determination of the physical dimensions
and hydrologic features of estuarine systems of the United States.  These data
are  compiled in a consistent manner to allow users to distinguish the
similarities and  differences among individual estuaries or groups of
estuaries.  The physical  characteristics of an estuary are primary
determinants of estuarine processes and  ultimately affect the ecology of a
system.
The principal physical parameter for which data are  compiled is the Estuarine
Drainage Area (EDA).  Other dimensional parameters  include the estuary length,
width, and depth; the fluvial drainage area, or FDA (the  land and water
portion of the entire watershed upstream of the EDA); and the  estuarine water
surface area.  The seaward boundary of each estuary is identified, and  the
estuary's length, area and volume is estimated for five salinity zones (from
tidal  fresh to seawater).  Estimates are also generated for the average daily
and monthly  freshwater inflow (representing the streams discharging into the
the entire drainage  basin), tidal prism (the volume of water entering a
coastal system during flood tide),  and prevailing tide (diurnal or
semidiurnal) for each estuary.  Estuaries are classified  according to degree
of salinity stratification (highly stratified, moderately stratified, and
vertically homogeneous classifications, reported for three-month periods).
Estuarine Land-Use Categories
The types of land use within an estuarine drainage basin indicate the overall
extent to which human activities may affect the environmental quality of the
basin and  its waters.  The NEI compiles information relating to the types of
land uses within the  drainage basins associated with major estuaries of the
United States.  When  combined with information about other estuarine
characteristics, land-use data may be  used to assess the effects of various
policies on the environmental quality of the  Nation's estuarine resource base.
The data base includes surface area estimates of seven  categories and 24
subcategories of land uses in areas surrounding major estuaries.   Categories
include urban and built-up land (such as residential and  industrial/commercial
complexes), Agriculture, Range, Forest, Barren (such as  beaches and dry salt
flats), and Wetland land use types.  Area estimates are compiled  for three
spatial units: (1) estuarine drainage areas (EDAs); (2) USGS cataloging units
(the portion that falls within an EDA); and (3) counties that fall within or
intersect EDAs  (area estimates for the entire county).
The data base encompasses 92 estuaries of the contiguous United  States.
Estimates are compiled for 92 EDAs, 216 USGS cataloging units, and 523
counties that fall within or intersect an EDA.  The spatial resolution of the
supporting  data is 10 or 40 acres, depending on the land-use category.
Land-use data were recorded between 1971 and 1984 and  compiled during the
mid-1980s.
Susceptibility of Estuaries to Nutrient Discharges
The NEI compiles data on the annual nutrient loads entering estuaries and  the
relative susceptibility of estuaries to nutrient-related pollution.  These data
allow  water quality and resource managers to identify estuaries that are
potentially at risk to  nutrient loads and subsequently, to eutrophication
conditions.
Data relate to parameters that influence estuarine  eutrophication, based on
nutrient loading estimates and physical and hydrologic  characteristics.
Nutrient loading data include estimates of the total nitrogen and the  total
phosphorus discharged annually into estuaries from point, nonpoint, and
upstream sources.  The relative susceptibility of estuaries to nutrient
pollution is  quantified by the dissolved concentration potential (DCP), an
estimate of the relative  ability of an estuary to concentrate dissolved
substances, such as nitrogen and  phosphorus.  This value characterizes the
effect of flushing and estuarine dilution on  pollutant loads.  A
classification scheme, indicating high, medium or low DCP values,  is used to
provide a relative ranking of estuaries in terms of their susceptibility to
nutrient pollution.
The level of nutrient pollution is identified by the estimated concentrations
of nitrogen  and phosphorus, a classification of those concentrations (high,
medium and low  concentrations), and an estimate of what percentage change
(increase or decrease) in  nutrient loadings would be required to change the
nutrient concentration  classifications.  Additional data include the molecular
ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus  (N/P), which provides an estimate of which
nutrient may be more influential in limiting  phytoplankton production.
The data encompass 82 estuaries identified in the NEI: 23 in the  Northeast; 17
in the Southeast; 23 on the Gulf of Mexico; and 19 on the West coast.   The
data represent overall estuarine conditions, not site-specific conditions
within an  estuary
Nutrient susceptibility studies were completed in 1990.   Supporting physical
and hydrologic data were generated primarily in the last decade.   Loading
estimates were derived from pollutant discharge data generated for the 1982
base year.  Base-year estimates can be considered to approximate discharge
conditions for a five-year period around the base year.
The National Estuarine Eutrophication Project
The National Estuarine Eutrophication Project is a data collection effort
designed to quantify the degree and geographical extent of eutrophication in
coastal  estuaries, and to test the hypothesis that nutrient loads and
eutrophic waters are  linked.  The Project expands upon related NEI studies,
involving estuarine  susceptibility to nutrient loadings (noted above), by
assessing actual eutrophication  problems and their characteristics.  A goal of
the Project is to develop a model linking  nutrient loading concentrations and
phytoplankton production to determine the  probability of eutrophication
conditions.
Data will be collected on a variety of factors which  characterize
eutrophication conditions and effects.  Hydrologic characteristics, such as
water residence times and circulation patterns, determine the ability of an
estuary to  concentrate nutrient loads.  The Project will examine such physical
indicators as  flushing, salinity, stratification, and tides.  Data also will
be collected on factors which  express eutrophication effects, including: 1)
water quality parameters, such as oxygen  concentrations in bottom waters;
nutrient concentrations; light penetration; turbidity;  and 2) biological
parameters, such as phytoplankton production (primary production);  the
appearance of nuisance seaweeds, algal blooms and floating algal scums;
decreased submerged aquatic vegetation concentrations; benthic organism
concentration and composition; bacterial activity; disease organisms (for
marine  populations); and secondary production (commercial harvests).
The National Estuarine Eutrophication Project was initiated in  1991, however,
supporting data may relate to environmental conditions recorded at  earlier
dates.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

Scientific Objectives:
Surface radiation budget data have the potential for contributing
significantly to improved understanding of the four major components
of the climate system: the oceans, the land surface, the cryosphere,
and the atmosphere.  Radiative fluxes into the ocean surface provide
an important boundary forcing for the ocean general circulation.
Furthermore, since the radiative fluxes into the ocean surface are
significantly modulated by boundary layer parameters (e.g., clouds,
atmospheric humidity, and temperature), SRB may be an important factor
in air-sea interactions.  With respect to the land surface, the net
radiative balance governs the turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible
heat from the surface into the atmosphere.  Surface radiative fluxes
are also needed for studies related to the energy and water balance of
plant canopies.  For the cryosphere, the pack ice and its interaction
with surface temperature and solar radiation provides the so-called
ice-albedo feedback which is a vital component governing climate
trends on decadal to longer time scales.  Finally, the knowledge of
SRB together with top-of-atmosphere Earth radiation budget data can
yield, for the first time, observational estimates of tropospheric
radiative heating and cloud radiative forcing.
Project Description:
The Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) data sets are derived from a
variety of data sources.  The primary data source is the International
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) C1 data product.  Using
the ISCCP C1 parameters as input, SRB results are generated using two
different algorithms.  The Pinker algorithm (developed jointly by
Drs. R.T. Pinker and I. Laszlo form the University of Maryland) is a
physical model which uses an iterative procedure based on
delta-Eddington radiative transfer calculations.  The Staylor
algorithm (developed by Mr. W.F. Staylor from the NASA Langley
Research Center) is a parameterized physical model in which both cloud
and aerosol transmission characteristics have been separately tuned to
historical data at various locations around the globe.  Earth
Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) data are also used as input to the
models, as well as for top-of-atmosphere (TOA) irradiance comparisons
with the Pinker Model output.  The Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology, Zurich, provides ground-truth fluxes from the Global
Energy Budget Archive (GEBA).  These data are used for validation of
the Pinker and Staylor calculated downward shortwave surface
irradiances.  SRB uses the same equal area grid system as that used by
ISCCP for its C1 product.  The equal-area grid contains 6596 cells
covering the globe; where a cell is approximately 280 km x 280 km at
the equator.
Data Products
-------------
The SRB data package consists of daily and monthly shortwave
parameters covering a forty-six month period from March 1985 through
December 1988.  The principle parameters in the data sets are Pinker
and Staylor calculated irradiances for the surface and
top-of-atmosphere.  The total SRB data package for each month consists
of six files.  The first file is the ASCII header file, named
README.MMMYY.  The second and third files are ASCII showing Fortran
listings of the Pinker and Staylor algorithms (PINKER.FOR and
STAYLOR.FOR, respectively).  The fourth and fifth files are binary
data files in HDF format.  The fourth file is the monthly binary file
and presents monthly average gridded values for 52 different items in
each cell (srb_monavgs_yymm).  The fifth file is the daily binary file
and presents 24-hr daily average values for 10 key items in each cell
(srb_dayavgs_yymm).  The sixth file (b_srb_monavgs_yymm.hdf) is a
graphics file which contains 19 global images in HDF format.  The
intent is to allow the user to quickly browse the most important SRB
parameters without the requirement to read the entire data set.

A oceanografia biológica difere da biologia marinha por estudar os organismos marinhos com um enfoque mais ecológico, relacionado com a física, a química e a geologia do oceano.

Na oceanografia biológica se dividem os organismos marinhos em três categorias: plâncton, nécton e bentos. O plâncton é formado pelos organismos que vivem na coluna de água sem conseguirem nadar contra as correntes marinhas. O nécton é constituído pelos organismos que tem boa capacidade natatória, não dependendo de correntes para se deslocarem. O bentos é formado pelos organismos que vivem no substrato, fixados ou não.

GPM Constellation is a joint mission with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and other international partners. Building upon the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), it will initiate the measurement of global precipitation, a key climate factor. Its science objectives are: to improve ongoing efforts to predict climate by providing near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes; to improve the accuracy of weather and precipitation forecasts through more accurate measurement of rain rates and latent heating; and to provide more frequent and complete sampling of the Earth's precipitation. GPM Constellation is envisioned to consist of a core spacecraft to measure precipitation structure and to provide a calibration standard for the constellation spacecraft, an international constellation of NASA and contributed spacecraft to provide frequent precipitation measurements on a global basis, calibration/validation sites distributed globally with a broad array of precipitation-measuring instrumentation, and a global precipitation data system to produce and distribute global rain maps and climate research products.

The International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental
Change (IHDP) was originally launched in 1990 by ISSC as the Human
Dimensions Programme (HDP).  The restructured IHDP is a full partner
with the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the World
Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and DIVERSITAS. These GEC programmes
focus on climatic, biogeochemical, socio-economic and biodiversity
processes related to global environmental change. In February 1996,
ICSU joined ISSC as co-sponsor of the IHDP.
IHDP is an international, interdisciplinary, non-governmental social
science programme dedicated to pro-moting and co-ordinating research
aimed at describing, analysing and understanding the human dimensions
of global environmental change. In order to accomplish its goals,
IHDP:
-  links researchers, policy-makers and stakeholders,
-  promotes synergies among national and regional research committees and
   programmes
- identifies new research priorities, provides a focus and new
  frameworks for interdisciplinary research, and
- facilitates the dissemination of research results.
This strategy is based on a bottom-up approach which builds upon
existing researchers and research results around the world. Particular
emphasis is placed on expanding and strengthening the network of
national human dimensions committees and programmes and on enhancing
the IHDP's capacity to support them.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Experiment Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones Atlantic</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

Scientific Objectives:
 -Understanding the fundamental physical processes occuring in the
  atmosphere during rapid intensification of cyclones at sea.
 -Determining those physical processes that need to be incorporated
  into dynamical prediction models.
 -Identifying measurable precursors as necessary input into the
  initial analysis for accurate and detailed operational model predictions.
Project Description:
     The Experiment on Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones over the Atlantic (ERICA),
under the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Heavy Weather at Sea Accelerated
Research Initiative program, is a study to determine physical mechanisms and
processes which lead to explosive wintertime storms developing over the
Atlantic Ocean.  ERICA is a follow-up study to the Genesis of Atlantic Lows
Experiment (GALE), conducted in the winter of 1986.  Other contributors include
several departments of the Navy and the Air Force as well as the National
Weather Service (NWS), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS),
Environmental Research Laboratory (ERL), Department of Transportation (DOT),
Department of Energy (DOE), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Center
for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Air Weather Service (AWS), Atmospheric
Environment Service (AES) of Toronto, Canada, along with universities and
research organizations in the United States and Canada.  Operations are being
carried out at three main centers; the World Weather Building, Camp Springs,
Maryland, Maritimes Weather Center, Bedford, Nova Scotia and Naval Air Station,
Brunswick, Maine.  The field phase of ERICA began 1 December 1988 and ended 26
February 1989.  The experiment was designed to focus on east coast winter
storms that rapidly intensified over a few hours and a few hundred kilometers
and deepened tens of millibars per six hours.  These ERICA-type storms in the
previous 22 years before the field study mainly developed over the northwestern
Atlantic from Washington D.C. to St Johns, Newfoundland.
Data Sources:
     The ERICA observing region covers the eastern half of the United States,
similar to that observed during GALE, as well as southeastern Canada and the
northwestern Atlantic west of 50 degrees west.  Rawinsonde observations are
being supplied by the NWS and NCAR (CLASS-Cross Chain Loran Atmospheric
Sounding System).  Canada's AES and military are providing standard
meteorological parameters.  The satellite observations are being taken from
GOES-6 and GOES-7, NOAA-10 and NOAA-11, DMSP-F8 and F9 and GEOSAT which provide
radiance measurements.  Surface observations are being supplied by the standard
NWS network along with the FAA, Coast Guard and military stations.  Nova Scotia
has also set up a ground-based network (Mesonet) to measure temperature,
pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction.  The meteorological buoy network
is supported by NOAA, Navy, AES and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutite
(WHOI) measuring surface and sub-surface parameters.  Ship data is also being
obtained and quality controlled by the NWS and the ECMWF.  Aircraft
observations are being provided by the Air Force, Navy, NOAA and NCAR; the Air
Force flights deploying omega dropsondes and gathering cyclonic-scale data over
the ocean, the NCAR missions accumulating jet stream structure data that could
impact the rapid intensification phase, the NOAA flights over the low-level
cyclone, frontal zones, updraft zones and convective regions, and the Navy
missions deploying drifting buoys and dropwindsondes.  Radar observations are
being provided by NWS, NOAA (Doppler/non Doppler) and the Air Force Geophysics
Laboratory (Doppler).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Ecosystem Indicator Partnership (ESIP) is a committee of the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment. ESIP is developing indicators for the Gulf of Maine and integrating regional data for a new Web-based reporting system for marine ecosystem monitoring. Activities of ESIP initially center on convening regional practitioners in six indicator areas: coastal development, contaminants and pathogens, eutrophication, aquatic habitat, fisheries and aquaculture, and climate change.

Decision-makers in the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy region will possess the necessary information to preserve ecological integrity and to sustain economically and socially healthy human communities. Regional ecosystem indicators, developed in a manner that is guided by science and supported by routine monitoring, demonstrate patterns of change in the ecosystem. By presenting and interpreting these indicators in biennial state of the environment reports, information will be communicated in a manner that decision-makers at all societal levels can use to shape their priorities and guide their choices. The gulf-wide insights provided through indicators and state of the environment reports will integrate across multiple jurisdictional boundaries that exist within the Gulf ecosystem and will complement other information used by decision-makers. By creating links among science, management, ecosystem, and community goals at both regional and local levels, this information will help decision-makers understand the larger implications of their choices.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GREen Network of Excellence - Arctic Climate Change Research Project (GRENE-Arctic) is funded for 5 years starting in FY2011 and jointly managed by the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) and JAMSTEC. Four strategic research targets are set: ① Understanding the mechanism of warming amplification in the Arctic, ② Understanding the Arctic system for global climate and future change, ③Evaluation of the impacts of Arctic change on weather and climate in Japan, marine ecosystems and ﬁsheries, and ④Projection of sea ice distribution and Arctic sea routes. Now over 300 scientists from 35 organizations are participating in the Project, tackling all aspects of the Arctic climate system; the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, land and ecosystems from a multi-disciplinary approach.
  The Project also fosters close collaboration between model and observational studies. Their results complement to each other. Model results help to interpret observations while observations are used to constrain models and validate model outputs. Data archiving efforts in the Project further enhance this close relationship between model and observational studies. Last but not least, the Project seeks and promotes international collaboration with other institutes in various nations, which is essential for Arctic research, while the Japan Consortium for Arctic Environmental Research (JCAR) is founded to bolster Arctic research activities within Japan.

The Global Ecosystems Database (GED) project began in 1990 as an
Interagency project between the National Geophysical Data Center
(NGDC) of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's (EPA) Environmental Research Laboratory in Corvallis,
Oregon (ERL-C). The primary objective of the project was to
produce a spatially integrated database (including observational
time sequences and model simulation outputs) with high quality
metadata for characterization and modeling support within the US
Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). Datasets were selected
for publication to meet research priorities established by the
EPA/ERL-C and to expand the use of datasets of potential value
to the modeling and applied research community.

Project Goals:

1. Prepare and document important global change research
datasets for intercomparison, verification, further research,
and applied use related to global climate change and landscape
ecology.

2. Integrate and publish these datasets to improve their
transfer between disciplines and to the broadest possible user
base.

3. Collaborate in developing useful ecosystem indices and
meeting data integration requirements of specific user groups

Datasets:

All datasets are provided in integrated Geographic Information
System (GIS) form. In cases where NGDC has authority for
distribution of the original dataset, the complete source
version is provided on the data product in the form it was
contributed. This project thus meets two product requirements:
It provides an integrated version of commonly used global and
regional research datasets related to landscape ecological
characterization and modeling for a variety of uses in various
disciplines; and it distributes original versions of such
datasets contributed to NGDC for public distribution.

GED Datasets are defined by authorship, however they are grouped
by database according to their geographic compatibility. Each
database is defined by geographic coverage, reference system,
and projection. Resolution will vary between global, regional,
and local databases, but may also vary within a database. Link

During last decades in the Euroarctic Region there is observed a stable tendency towards warming that enables us to assume that this is not a short-time deviations of the climatic system from the equilibrium but long-lasted changes. To main factors forming the climate of the Spitsbergen Archipelago one could refer its geographical location, atmospheric circulation, ocean impact, sea and continental ice sheet, complicated morphometrics.
On the Spitsbergen Archipelago there exists the huge mass of fresh water in a form of cryosphere elements (glaciers, snow cover, naleds), it has a specific biota and at the same time locates in the area of a relatively intensive economic activity compared with other Arctic Archipelagos... Thus, Cryosphere, Hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere of the Archipelago is a noticeable objects-indicator of the current status of the Arctic climate system and estimates of its future changes. Along with this Spitsbergen is a wonderful science platform for studying the overall spectrum of reactions of Polar Regions nature on the climate variations both of natural and anthropogenic origin.
Nowadays, a large complex of scientific researches and monitoring of the Spitsbergen Archipelago environment is carried out on the basis of the infrastructure of the Russian village Barents burg, Norwegian villages Longierbuen and New-Alesunn and also the Polish research base Hornsunn. Meteorological, aerological, ice, oceanographic, biological and other observations are performed.
It is considered to perform the following complex investigations of the Spitsbergen Archipelago environment in the framework of this project:
Main project goals are: 
- development and unification of the existing system of complex monitoring of the principal climate forming parameters of the environment status in the area of the Spitsbergen Archipelago 
estimation of the features of the present status of the principal components of the climatic and systems of the Archipelago and surrounding Euro-Arctic aquatic regions -on the basis of the analysis of databases obtained during the project implementation and historical Russian and available international databases ;
Understanding of the impact mechanisms of external climate factors on the nature of the Spitsbergen Archipelago;
development of the scientific basis of the scenarios of possible climate changes of the Archipelago environment and forecast of possible ecological impact;
- improvement of the technology and technical means for the system of hydrometeorological monitoring of the environment.
The investigations are complex ones. So, there are some separate sub-programs co-operating in the framework of general research program including the following directions:
-Meteorological regime;
-Hydrological regime of dry land;
-Energy-exchange processes between the atmosphere and underlying surface;
-Ice-cover evolution;
-Structure and dynamics of coastal waters including fiords; 
-Climate and fresh water balance;
-Sea-ice evolution; 
- Monitoring of contamination of air and water ambience
-Studies of the composite and concentration of radio-active gases in the atmosphere and ocean;
-Flora and fauna research;
-Validation of results from remote sounding of the environment components;
-Testing and experimental service of new measurement complexes for the Archipelago environment monitoring. 
Implementation of the above sub-programs will be realized on the basis of ZGMO «Baretsburg» (AARI, Murmansk ASMS), Norwegian research station in New Alesunn village (NPI) and Polish station in the Hornsunn Bay (Polish Academy of Sciences). Also it is assumed to perform, on the basis of the previous AARI field studies on the Archipelago, the constant-basis observations at a number of geographical objects (glaciers, lakes, river valleys, etc) for which there exist multi-year sets of field data. Here we suppose to use both automation measuring complexes and random observations using helicopters, sea- vehicles etc.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defenses in Antarctic Marine Organisms</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Summary of Project:

The normal use of oxygen by aerobic organisms produces several active
species of oxygen.  The first derivative that forms is the anion
superoxide (O2-) that is a species with a negative charge, slightly
diffusible and relatively stable, with characteristics of free radical
(elements with a free electron).  The second product of reduction is
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a highly diffusible, stable molecule.

The union of these two species, in the presence of hemoproteins (for
example: hemoglobin, hemocyanin, etc.) containing prosthetic group
transition metals, generates a new, extremely reactive species, the
radical hydroxyl (OH-).  This radical has a very short half life and,
therefore, interacts with compounds in its en be they proteins, lipids
or acids, producing reversible or irreversible damage depending on its
concentration.

Aerobic animals and vegetables have within their cells enzymatic and
nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses.

Within the enzymatic defenses we found: a) superoxide dismutase (SOD),
b) catalase (CAT) and c) glutathione peroxidase (GPx):

a) Superoxide dismutase (SOD) with superoxide (O2-) anion produces
hydrogen peroxide (equation 1):
O2- + 2 H+ ---&gt; H2O2       (1)
This enzyme contains prosthetic group transition metals for oxidation
- reduction necessary for the dismutation of this species.

b) Metabolized CAT to hydrogen peroxide turning it to water (equation
2):
2H2O2 ---&gt; 2H2O + O2     (2)
This enzyme is peroxisomal in behavior, and, in addition to its
catalytic function, it can conduct a peroxidative battle with much
lesser efficiency.

c) GPx can also transform hydrogen peroxide into water and
additionally metabolizes organic peroxides such as lipoperoxides
(equation 3):
2 GSH + ROOH ---&gt; GSSG + ROH + H2O     (3)
This enzyme uses as substrate a non-enzymatic antioxidant, - reduced
glutathione (GSH).  This antioxidant is distributed widely in
different organs.  Its function is fundamental to maintaining
oxidation balance.  Another important non-enzymatic antioxidant is
ascorbic acid (vitamin C).  Ascorbic acid is crucial in the
replacement of the antioxidant activity of vitamin E.  Also, vitamin
E, like vitamin A, is a liposoluble that is found in cell membranes,
catching or extinguishing excited species that are generated in the
reduction of oxygen.

Potentially, oxidative stress is experienced by aerobic organisms when
antioxidant defenses are surpassed by pro-oxidating forces.  This
mechanism has been implied in carcinogenesis, ischemia and reperfusion
damage, inflammation and aging.  Evidence suggests that the health of
aquatic organisms is linked to the level of oxidative stress to which
they may have been exposed (Di Giulio et al., 1989).  In particular,
regarding processes by which natural atmospheric conditions or the
presence of pollutants have increased the level of pro-oxidating
substances.

The extreme physical characteristics of the Antarctic marine
environment provide a challenge in confronting the oxidative
metabolism of the organisms that inhabit it, since natural situations
like, for example, the high oxygen content in the cold waters or
greater exposure to UV radiation (due to the hole in the ozone layer),
would have to lead to an adaptation in the activity of metabolizing
enzymes of the reduced oxygen species, and non-enzymatic antioxidants.
Similarly, the presence of transition metals and/or xenobiotic
substances in the water produce oxidative stress in the organisms
exposed to these substances (Winston, 1991).

Project Duration: 2002 - 2004

En Espanol:
Resumen del Proyecto:

  Como consecuencia de la utilizacion normal del oxigeno por los
organismos aerobicos, se producen varias especies activas del oxigeno.

  El primer derivado que se forma es el anion superoxido (O2.-) que es
una especie con carga, poco difusible y relativamente estable, con
caracteristicas de radical libre (elementos con un electron
desapareado). El segundo producto de la reduccion es el peroxido de
hidrogeno (H2 O2), molecula estable altamente difusible.

        La union de estas dos especies, en presencia de hemoproteinas (por
ejemplo: hemoglobina, hemocianina, etc.) que contengan metales de
transicion en su grupo prostetico, genera una nueva especie
extremadamente reactiva que es el radical hidroxilo (OH.). Este
radical tiene una vida media muy corta por lo que interactua con los
compuestos de sus alrededores ya sean proteinas, lipidos o acidos
nucleicos, produciendo danos de caracter reversible o irreversible
dependiendo de su concentracion.

        Los animales y vegetales aerobios tienen dentro de sus celulas
defensas antioxidantes enzimaticas y no enzimaticas radical hidroxilo
(OH.). Este radical tiene una vida media muy corta por lo que
interactua con los compuestos de sus alrededores ya sean proteinas,
lipidos o acidos nucleicos, produciendo danos de caracter reversible o
irreversible dependiendo de su concentracion.

        Los animales y vegetales aerobios tienen dentro de sus celulas
defensas antioxidantes enzimaticas y no enzimaticas.

  Dentro de las defensas enzimaticas encontramos: a) superoxido
dismutasa (SOD), b) catalasa (CAT) y c) glutation peroxidasa (GPx).

a) La SOD dismuta el anion superoxido a peroxido de hidrogeno (ecuacion 1).
 O2.-    + 2 H+  ---&gt; H2 O2        (1)

Esta enzima contiene metales de transicion en su grupo prostetico con
los que realiza las oxido - reducciones necesarias para la dismutacion
de esta especie.

b) La CAT metaboliza al peroxido de hidrogeno convirtiendolo en agua
(ecuacion 2).

2 H2O2 ---&gt; 2 H2O + O2     (2)

Esta enzima es de ubicacion peroxisomal y ademas de su funcion
catalitica puede realizar una accion peroxidativa con mucha menor
eficiencia.

c) La GPx tambien puede transformar el peroxido de hidrogeno en agua y
ademas metaboliza peroxidos de tipo organicos tales como los
lipoperoxidos (ecuacion 3)

2 GSH +  ROOH  ? GSSG + ROH + H2O  (3)

Esta enzima utiliza como sustrato a un antioxidante no enzimatico, que
es el glutation reducido (GSH). Este antioxidante se encuentra
ampliamente distribuido en los distintos organos. Su funcion es
fundamental para mantener el equilibrio oxidativo.

  Otro de los antioxidantes no enzimaticos importantes es el acido
ascorbico (vitamina C). Este compuesto es fundamental en la reposicion
de la actividad antioxidante de la vitamina E. Tanto la vitamina E
como la A son compuestos de caracteristicas liposolubles que se
encuentran en la membrana de las celulas atrapando o apagando las
especies excitadas que se generan en la reduccion del oxigeno.  El
estres oxidativo, potencialmente, es experimentado por todos los
organismos aerobicos cuando las defensas antioxidantes son superadas
por las fuerzas prooxidantes. Este mecanismo se ha visto implicado en
carcinogenesis, dano de isquemia y reperfusion, inflamacion y
envejecimiento. Existe evidencia que indica que la salud de los
organismos acuaticos puede estar ligada al nivel de estres oxidativo
al que se encuentran expuestos (Di Giulio et al., 1989). En particular
sobre aquellos procesos por los cuales las condiciones naturales del
ambiente o la presencia de sustancias contaminantes hubiesen
incrementado el nivel de prooxidantes presentes.

Las caracteristicas fisicas extremas del medio ambiente marino
antartico, plantean un desafio a confrontar sobre el metabolismo
oxidativo de los organismos que lo habitan, ya que situaciones
naturales como, por ejemplo, el alto contenido de oxigeno de sus frias
aguas o la mayor exposicion a la radiacion UV (debido a la presencia
del agujero en la capa de ozono), deberian conducir a una adaptacion
en la actividad de las enzimas metabolizadoras de las especies
reducidas del oxigeno y en los niveles de los antioxidantes no
enzimaticos. Del mismo modo la presencia de metales de transicion y/o
de sustancias xenobioticas organicas en el agua se sabe que producen
estres oxidativo en los organismos expuestos a dichas sustancias
(Winston, 1991).  Duracion: 2002 - 2004

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=82

This proposal outlines the LICHEN research project, which focuses on the languages and cultures of the northern circumpolar region. Faced with minority languages, governments have pursued policies of assimilation. This has applied to indigenous languages in Canada, to Gaelic and Scots in Scotland, and to Finnic minority languages in the Circumpolar region. The consequence of such policies has been the creation of ambivalent or negative feelings towards the mother tongue already in childhood, leading to low self-esteem, educational underachievement, unemployment and economic deprivation, and a variety of social and health problems. It is thus clear that language and culture are as important to the survival and well-being of populations as more obvious ecological and social issues.

The aim of the project is twofold: firstly, to create an electronic framework for the collection, management, online display, and exploitation of existing corpora of the languages of the circumpolar regions, which is also applicable to other corpora that represent regional, social and other varieties of languages. To achieve this we rely on close collaboration between several well-established corpus projects to discuss common goals, needs and problems and to identify best practices. Secondly, the project aims to collect, preserve and disseminate information about the languages spoken in the region, thus also enabling research on them. This will also help promote the linguistic confidence and self-image of the speakers of these languages, strengthening their cultural awareness and facilitating cross-cultural communication between these peoples in an age of rapid global change. Thus, the project will benefit not only the academic community, but also the speakers of the languages concerned, and indeed other communities around the world battling with the same kinds of issues.

The electronic framework is being developed at the University of Oulu, Finland, as a joint venture between the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Humanities and in collaboration with other project members and international experts. Within IPY 2007-2008 both an intranet and an internet version of the framework will be developed. In addition to this the project members will participate in the collection of data and dissemination of information. Each member has a unique goal within the project: some already have data, which may need digitization or formatting to be usable within the framework; others are looking to collect data. All members share a need for common practices and common tools to make the most use out of the data available.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interactions (SBI) project focuses on shelf, shelf break and upper-slope water mass and ecosystem modifications, material fluxes and biogeochemical cycles. The geographical focus is on the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and adjacent upper slopes, with the aim of generalization of the results into Pan Arctic and global models. The overarching goal of the SBI project is to understand the physical and biogeochemical processes that link the Arctic shelves, slopes, and deep basins. Relevant to this proposal, the SBI project will focus on a) biogeochemical modifications of Pacific water over the Beaufort and Chukchi shelf and slope regions, with emphasis on carbon and nitrogen; and b) comparative analysis of the findings over the broad Chukchi shelf and narrow Beaufort shelf and adjacent slopes to facilitate integration of the Western Arctic into a Pan-Arctic perspective. We will support the goals of SBI by evaluating the processes of carbon and nitrogen transport, exchanges and transformations in the regions of interest. Our specific interests will be: a) determination of mass transport and fate of carbon and nitrogen associated with the volume transports calculated by SBI collaborators; b) interpretation of carbon and nitrogen spatial distributions and temporal variability relative to biological and physical conditions; c) evaluation of partitioning of organic matter between dissolved and particulate phases; d) determination of net community production and its fate as DOM, suspended POM, and sinking POM; e) determination of C:N stoichiometry as a complement to biological studies, particularly in relation to community structure and seasonal progression of intense phytoplankton blooms in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas; and f) evaluation of the contribution of DOM vs. POM to apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) development in the Arctic halocline and export from the shelf. We will measure the full suite of carbon and nitrogen variables in survey mode. These include dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), as well as dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON). Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), a required variable, will be measured by the Category 2 hydrographic team contracted by SBI. We will also measure alkalinity to aid in identification of water masses, and the seawater pCO2 (e.g., ?pCO2) of the surface water to estimate air/sea flux of CO2). DOC, DIC, total alkalinity, and seawater pCO2 will be determined at sea. DON, PON, and POC will be analyzed at our shore labs. We require that 4 individuals from our groups (2 for organic variables and 2 for inorganic variables) join each of two 6-week processes cruises each summer (2002 and 2004). Synthesis of data will progress throughout the five-year project, culminating in the overarching final year synthesis. We anticipate ongoing synthesis and modeling collaborations with other funded SBI groups, including the physical oceanographic and tracer groups, the service groups and biological studies groups.

The TExas and FLorida UNderflights (TEFLUN) Experiment is a
mission to obtain validation measurements for the Tropical Rain
Measuring Mission (TRMM). TRMM is a NASA and National Space
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) coordinated mission that
launched the TRMM satellite on 28 November 1997 with a unique
complement of sensors to remotely observe rainfall throughout
the global tropics. TEFLUN is the first in a series of
experiments using a combination of airborne and surface-based
measurements to complement the satellite data. Among these, are
important measurements aboard the NASA high-altitude aircraft,
similar to those on the TRMM satellite. They are used for
direct intercomparisons with TRMM overflights where possible,
but more frequently to simulate TRMM data by flying over
precipitation systems within the experimental domain. These,
along with surface-based measurements and computer models, will
make unique contributions to our understanding of the tropical
precipitati!  on cycle.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Fire in Global Resources and Environmental Monitoring</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

Background and rationale:
At some time or another most of the world's terrestrial ecosystems are
directly affected by fire. Though some fires occur naturally
(wildfires), by far the greater part are the result of human
activities. Much of the world's tropical savannahs are periodically
burned; in Africa alone around 75% of the savannah burns annually, an
area of more than 300 millions hectares. Forest fires, savannahs
fires, burning of fuel wood, charcoal production and burning of
agricultural wastes together consume an estimated 8680 million tons of
dry plant material per year.
The consequences of biomass burning are extremely diverse. It affects
atmospheric chemistry, climate, vegetation distribution and, of course
human avtivities. The ecological, environmental and economic effects
of biomass burning occur across all scales, from the local to global,
yet systematic documentation of global biomass burning patterns and
history are not available. This lack of information is keenly felt,
both by the international scientific community, and by policy
makers. The research project FIre in global Resource and Environmental
monitoring (FIRE) has been initiated in 1994, by the Monitoring of
Tropical Vegetation unit (MTV) of the Commission of the European Union
Joint Research Centre, in order to adress such issues during a 4 years
period, with a key objective being the documenting of biomass burning
patterns for the entire tropical belt and the analysis of such
patterns in relation to land use/land cover dynamics.
An integrated approach to biomass burning studies:
At the 1991 Dahlem Workshop on Global Changes in the Perspective of
the Past, a proposal was made to integrate established fire behaviour
and emission models into a new approach, where ecosystem
characterisation, in terms of fuel situation and satellite
identification of fire occurrence are the starting point. The FIRE
project is concentrating in particular on those acpects of the Dahlem
model driven by satellite data.
Satellite observations as main source of information:
Earth observation from space provides systematic and consistent
measurements of a series of parameters related to fire and fire
impacts. Fire detection from space currently relies on visible and
thermal information from sensors on the Meteosat, Landsat, SPOT and
NOAA satellites.
These systems together cover a range of spatial, spectral and temporal
resolutions which on the one hand permit detailed study of individual
fires, and on the other allow regular monitoring of the incidence of
fire for entire continents.
The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the NOAA
satellites is the main source of data for the studies done by the FIRE
project.  Historical archives of these data, on a daily basis at 4 km
resolution (the Global Area Coverage data, GAC), extend back to 1981:
the FIRE project has done the processing and analysis of these
AVHRR-GAC data for the african continent. The resulting data sets are
used for continental scale vegetation studies, more specifically for
detection of land cover changes, and for documenting spatio- temporal
variations in burning patterns for the continent of Africa over the
last decade.
More complete documentation of burning patterns for the whole tropical
belt has been initiated by the FIRE project using the global 1-km
resolution AVHRR image archive established at the U.S. satellite data
archive, Sioux Falls, under the auspices of the IGBP. Analysis of
these data has required considerable development of processing
environments: An automatic method for global detection of vegetation
fires, which adjusts as necessary to accomodate seasonal and spatial
factors, has been developed and applied succesfully for the processing
and analysis of one week of daily global data (14 Gb of data). The
FIRE project is currently extending the processing to six months of
daily 1-km global data.
In the same time, detection and assessment of burnt areas are becoming
key issues in the overall research effort of the FIRE project. Data
provided by the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-1) onboard the
ERS satellite, are being used to quantify the extent of burnt
surfaces. Last, a mobile AVHRR data receiving station is used by the
FIRE project, in the framework of ground experimental campaigns, to
validate fire detection methods for different tropical ecosystems, and
to provide input to fire management programmes at country level.
Assembling and use of consistent data sets on
BB dynamics adapted to the modelling of
soil-vegetation-atmosphere exchanges and
their evolution in time
The FIRE project is involved in co-operative research related to the
role of biomass burning in tropospheric and precipitations chemistry,
forest monitoring, land cover changes. As such a great effort is done
to assemble and format the fire related informations, as derived from
remote sensing, in consistent data sets adapted to the modelling of
soil-vegetation- atmosphere exchanges and their evolution in time:
such data sets are currently sustaining the FIRE project contributions
to international experiments among which the IGBP-IGAC activity
EXPRESSO (EXPeriment for Regional Sources and Sinks of Oxydants) and
to a research activity of the European Union on the modelling of
emissions of black carbon aerosols at global scale. Moreover the FIRE
project is involved in a co-operative research with the UE's TREES
(TRopical Ecosystem and Environment observation from Space) project:
the detection of fires is an essential part of the alarm system under
development, in the TREES project, to pinpoint zones of active
deforestation.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=453

Communities living near, or within, the Arctic and Antarctic circles often feel like they are at the end of the world. IPY is an unprecedented opportunity that places polar residents right at the centre of this huge, international, global programme. The development of Polar Gateways provides an opportunity for these communities to get involved in IPY, to share their voice and concerns with the rest of the world, to unite neighbours who live at opposite ends of the world, to support the IPY community, and to reach a wide audience of tourists, media, educators, artists, and decision makers.

Polar Gateways proposes to establish centres at key access points to the Arctic and Antarctic. The initial proposal includes one centre in Ushuaia, Argentina, and one in Longyearbyen, Svalbard. Both of these locations are home to active communities who are excited about IPY and keen to get further involved. After establishing these centres, the hope is to extend the invitation to create similar initiatives within any interested polar gateway community, North and South. The result will therefore not only be a huge education and outreach programme for IPY, but will also connect polar communities around the world who share many concerns related to physical isolation and an immediate concern for the changing environment.

Polar Gateways will fulfil a range of functions, dependent on location. These may include:

-Present the IPY programme and contents in the form of displays and material
-Provide local support and a friendly face to the IPY community in the field
-Build a network of polar communities 
-Provide a natural link between IPY field activities and local initiatives
-Provide a focal point about IPY to media and tourists
-Provide a local space for interviews, meetings, education, information
-Support local capacity building
-Connect science and scientists to education and outreach programmes globally
-Educate about both poles from one location
-Be an outlet for IPY merchandise, leaflets, posters, cards, dvds, etc..
-Inform about the scientific content of IPY
-Contribute to the IPY.org web-log with local IPY stories and experiences
-Provide a contact point locally for IPY queries during the relevant field seasons
-Allow contact for the international media with IPY: icebergs, scientists and all!
-Build up an international database of close to the poles visitors-Connect Polar Gateways to each other, and activities in the Arctic and Antarctic, via web-cams and other technology 

Locations for the centres have already been suggested in both Ushuaia and Lonyearbyen, as well as strong community support. This is critical for the success of such a programme. It is envisaged that the Ushuaia Centre would open in time for the 2006-7 summer season and the Longyearbyen centre would be open in time for the 2007 season, thus catching the full length of IPY.

SSEOP office also maintains and populates the Shuttle data base
which catalogs all shuttle photography. Roughly 85 percent of
the acquired Shuttle photographs are Earth looking views. The
rest of the photographs may involve satellite deployments,
extravehicular activities and photographs within the Shuttle.

Most of the photographs are in natural color, although limited
amounts of black and white and color infrared-film have also
been acquired.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">The State and Fate of the Cryosphere</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: Cryos - State of the Cryosphere
Project URL: http://stratus.ssec.wisc.edu/ipy-cryos/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=105

The cryosphere, which includes sea-, lake-, and river-ice, snow cover, solid precipitation, glaciers, icebergs, ice sheets, ice caps, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground, plays a crucial role in not only the polar climate system, but also in the global climate system. It is inseparable from the polar freshwater system, both on land, ice and in the sea. Understanding the state of the cryosphere, and its associated past, present and future variability and change in time and space, is essential to understanding the polar environment in terms of its physical and biogeochemical interactions with the ocean, atmosphere and terrestrial systems, and the impacts on and interactions with social, cultural and economic systems. 
This project is proposed and supported by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) project to provide a framework for assessing the polar cryospheric system and the related physical and chemical processes, interactions and impacts within the Earth system. The IPY provides the opportunity for a coordinated circumpolar assessment of both polar regions by nations and their organizations, scientists, and residents that likely would not be otherwise undertaken.

The "State and Fate of the Polar Cryosphere" will establish links with the main projects (clusters) involved in monitoring, assessing, and understanding the variability, uncertainty, and change in the global cryosphere. This includes projects that will study permafrost, glaciers and ice sheets, sea ice, snow cover, and precipitation, as well as those involved in developing observing systems and data and information systems. We are also linking with projects involved in socioeconomic and cultural issues and those that will provide education and outreach, including traditional knowledge. (See section 4.2 for a complete list of participants.) The project will play a leadership, management, and coordinating role in the development of a sustained long-term cryospheric polar observing system, which would be implemented in the future through GCOS, GOOS, GTOS, CEOS, and possibly GEOSS. 

We propose to coordinate activities and synthesize results to: 
1. assess the current state of cryospheric parameters in the high latitude regions, providing a snapshot of the cryosphere and an evaluation of its current (IPY) state in the context of past states and projections of the future;
2. formulate the observational requirements of cryospheric variables for weather and climate monitoring and prediction and for other environmental assessments;
3. strengthen international cooperation in the development of cryospheric observing systems.

The CliC International Project Office will support the coordination, and the CliC Data and Information System (DISC, http://clic.npolar.no/disc/) will provide the portal on the current state of the global cryosphere.

The "State and Fate of the Polar Cryosphere" project will complement the newly developed Cryosphere Theme for the Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS), which is being developed jointly by CliC and SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) (http://stratus.ssec.wisc.edu/IGOS-cryo).

This project will also develop links to a number of diverse projects and activities that are examining the effects of a changing cryosphere on biological and human systems, e.g., the implications of changing polar snow cover characteristics on bird and mammal breeding. The aim is to document not only the changes that are happening to the global cryosphere, but to also highlight the diverse impacts of these changes.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Discovery (OV-103) was NASA's third space shuttle orbiter to join the fleet, arriving for the first time at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in November 1983.

After checkout and processing, it was launched on Aug. 30, 1984, for its first mission, 41-D, to deploy three communications satellites.

Since that inaugural flight, Discovery has completed more than 30 successful missions, surpassing the number of flights made by any other orbiter in NASA's fleet. Just like all of the orbiters, it has undergone some major modifications over the years. The most recent began in 2002 and was the first carried out at Kennedy. It provided 99 upgrades and 88 special tests, including new changes to make it safer for flight.

Discovery has the distinction of being chosen as the Return to Flight orbiter twice. The first was for STS-26 in 1988, and the second when it carried the STS-114 crew on NASA's Return to Flight mission to the International Space Station in July 2005.

The choice of the name "Discovery" carried on a tradition drawn from some historic, Earth-bound exploring ships of the past. One of these sailing forerunners was the vessel used in the early 1600s by Henry Hudson to explore Hudson Bay and search for a northwest passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

Another such ship was used by British explorer James Cook in the 1770s during his voyages in the South Pacific, leading to the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, two British Royal Geographical Society ships have carried the name "Discovery" as they sailed on expeditions to the North Pole and the Antarctic.

Destined for exploring the heavens instead of the seas, it was only fitting that NASA's Discovery carried the Hubble Space Telescope into space during mission STS-31 in April 1990, and provided both the second and third Hubble servicing missions (STS-82 in February 1997 and STS-103 in December 1999).

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=372

The proposed activity will build on the Polar View network and infrastructure to develop a single point of access to ice-related information for IPY investigators.

Polar View is an international consortium of members from government, industry and academia that have formed a strategic partnership to effect the operational monitoring of polar environments using Earth Observation (EO) technologies. Satellite monitoring is a powerful tool for polar monitoring. It is the only operational method to provide information over large and often inaccessible areas in a cost-effective manner. EO-derived information can support monitoring and analysis related to sustainable development (e.g. transportation, resource exploration, site remediation, bio-productivity monitoring), the environment (e.g. climate change, pollution, animal populations and habitats), and public safety (e.g. activity monitoring, disaster management, search and rescue). 

It is planned to provide expert control of the remotely sensed information collaboratively with responsible ice services on the basis of routine ice charts, in particular for areas experiencing higher probability for ambiguous interpretation, such as Antarctica, areas during melt season and the fast ice zone.

Funded under the European Space Agency (ESA)/European Commission Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative, Polar View brings together service providers, researchers and most of the world's national ice services to provide operational information services related to polar environments to international, national and local stakeholders worldwide. Polar View maintains close links with the JCOMM Expert Team on Sea Ice, the International Ice Charting Working Group, and the European and Canadian Space Agencies to support its operations.

A dedicated web portal will be developed to deliver Polar View IPY ice information. It will include a standard suite of products consisting of ice information routinely produced by the national ice services and Polar View for both logistics (e.g. sea ice distribution information for shipping) and science (e.g. development and detailed spatio-temporal distribution of ice leads). In addition, the specialized, custom-tailored products will be offered in support of specific IPY activities. The products will be generated primarily, but not exclusively, using EO data. The portal will be a convenient, single (although not the only) access point for ice-related information.

Polar View will contribute its existing mechanisms to minimize EO data acquisition conflicts and coordinate with EO data providers. Access to the information on the Polar View portal will be open to all IPY researchers.

While hurricane track prediction has improved in recent decades, improvements in hurricane intensity prediction have lagged, primarily as a result of a poor understanding of the processes involved in storm intensity change. The Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) is a five-year mission targeted to enhance our understanding of the processes that underlie hurricane intensity change in the Atlantic Ocean basin. HS3 will determine the extent to which either the environment or processes internal to the storm are key to intensity change.

The experiment involved three U.S. Department of Energy laboratories, one National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration laboratory, and several universities. The experiment was conducted in a region of severe contrasts in adjacent surface types that accentuated the response of the atmosphere to variable surface forcing. Large values of sensible-heat flux and low values of latent-heat flux characterized a sagebrush steppe area; significantly smaller sen- sible-heat fluxes and much larger latent-heat fluxes were associated with extensive tracts of irrigated farmland to the north, east, and west of the steppe. Data were obtained from an array of surface flux stations, remote-sensing devices, an instrumented aircraft, and soil and vegetation measurements. The data will be used to address the problem of extrapolating from a limited number of local measurements to area-averaged values of fluxes suitable for use in global climate models.

      The Biogeochemical Ocean Flux Study (BOFS) was a Community
      Research Project of the Marine and Atmospheric Sciences
      Directorate of the Natural Environment Research Council and was
      hosted by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory from April 1987 and
      April 1992, with a bridging to April 1993 for cruises to the
      Southern Oceans.  The North Atlantic field programme was
      conducted between May 1989 and July 1991.  BOFS formed a
      significant part of the UK's contribution to the IGBP's Joint
      Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS).

      From the outset, BODC took the lead role in organising and
      ensuring the proper management and processing of BOFS data.  The
      aim throughout was to make high quality data readily available
      to project scientists with minimal delay, and to ensure the
      publication of a comprehensive fully worked up data set at the
      end of the project.

Questions posed for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA):

1. Are global climate changes always triggered in the Northern
   Hemisphere or is also the opposite sequence possible?
2. How are global changes coupled between the two hemispheres?
3. Are rapid climatic changes also observed in previous climatic cycles?
4. Do transitions from glacial to interglacial periods and back follow
   always the same pattern or is there a variety of mechanisms
   involved?

Proposal:

Drill at two sites in Antarctica: In central East Antarctica at Dome C
and in the Atlantic sector in Dronning Maud Land at a site yet to be
determined.

Contributions:

1. Provide our expertise in the drilling technology and provide
   especially the drill tower, the winch control and the drill heads.

2. Measure several parameters along the ice core with Continuous Flow
   Analysis (CFA).

3. Measure the CO2 and CH4 concentration and the isotopic composition
   (d13C of CO2 and d18O of O2) of the air enclosed in bubbles and air
   hydrates.

4. Participate in the site selection for the drilling in the Atlantic
   sector.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Weddell Sea is part of the Southern Ocean. Its land boundaries are defined by the bay formed from the coasts of Coats Land and the Antarctic Peninsula. Much of the southern part of the sea, up to Elephant Island, is permanent ice, the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. The sea is contained within the two overlapping Antarctic territorial claims of Argentina, (Argentine Antarctica) and Britain (British Antarctic Territory), and also resides partially within the territorial claim of Chile (Antarctic Chilean Territory). At its widest the sea is around 2,000 km across, in area it is around 2.8 million km².

The sea is named after the British sailor James Weddell who entered the sea in 1823 as far as 74° S. It was first widely explored by the Scot William S. Bruce over 1902-04.

It was in this sea that Shackleton's ship, the Endurance was trapped and crushed by ice in 1915.

The ice shelves which used to extend roughly 3900 square miles (10,000 km²) over the Weddell Sea have completely disappeared by 2002.

The data are contained in one file which is in tar and compressed
format covering the period from January 1972 through December
1992. When this file is uncompressed and untarred, 21 HDF files are
generated. Each HDF file corresponds to one year within the data set
and contains 12 images (one image per month). The monthly total
precipitation is in a 129 by 171 element array. The data is based on
monthly rain datasets from Peru and Bolivia and daily rain datasets
from Brazil. The precipitation data is derived from a linear
interpolation of all stations within one degree with data from a
minimum of four stations. Topographic and other information is not
used in the interpolations. The precipitation data is in units of
total mm/month. The extent of the gridded data ranges from latitudes
of 20.2S to 5.6N and longitudes from 79.8W to 45.6W. The data are
extrapolated to the edge of the grid but are deemed reliable only over
the Amazon River Basin area.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      Background

      The northeastern Gulf of Mexico has been the focus of only a few
       oceanographic and/or meteorological studies. A survey (1982) by
       an Environmental Studies Program (ESP) contractor found but a
       few oceanographic datasets. Most of the available hydrographic
       data are from the 1970's Mississippi-Alabama-Florida
       surveys. Available current data are from the
       Mississippi/Alabama Marine Ecosystem Study (MMS Contract
       14-35-0001-30346), some Navy sponsored moorings near Pensacola,
       Chevron's moorings in the Destin Dome Area, a United States
       Geological Survey mooring south of Mobile, and several United
       States Army Corps of Engineers moorings on the inner
       shelf. Even though remote sensing data are probably the most
       recent information in this area, the synoptic collection of
       these images and their comparison with the data from other
       studies of the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico Physical
       Oceanography Program is essential to the understanding of the
       areal extent and timing of events such as intru!  sions,
       shelf/deep water exchanges, and river influence. Physical
       oceanography information in the northeastern Gulf is sufficient
       to make first order estimates of oil spill trajectories, but
       not enough to calculate the errors associated with these
       estimates.

      Objectives

1. The objectives of this study are to assess the utility of merging
   remote sensing and field data to: assess the utility data
   products for examining regional circulation patterns in the
   northeastern Gulf of Mexico (NEGOM);

2. Assess variability of dispersal patterns and sea surface
   temperature (SST) in the NEGOM;

3. Study the correlation between sea level changes and surface
   altimetry, atmospheric forcing, SST, and buoy tracks; and
   integrate these results with ongoing MMS sponsored studies in
   the NEGOM.

Subglacial Antarctic Lake Environments (SALE) will be an important target of exploration and research during the International Polar Year (IPY). Major campaigns by several nations that will culminate in a series of activities during the IPY have agreed to participate in SALE-UNITED. SALE-UNITED is closely aligned with the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Scientific Research Program Subglacial Antarctic Lake Environments (SALE). SALE-UNITED is a coalition of scientists, modellers and technologists from Belgium, Germany, France, Russia, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The interdisciplinary objectives of SALE-UNITED have been agreed during a series of international workshops and meetings of the SCAR SALE Group of Specialists (SALEGOS) over the last 6-7 years. SALE-UNITED will be an intensive period of exploration and study of subglacial lake environments advancing scientific discovery in glaciology, biogeochemistry, paleo-climate, biology, geology, tectonics, and ecology. The portfolio of SALE-UNITED projects will advance our understanding of the evolution of subglacial environments; their physical, chemical, and biological settings; the interconnectivity of subglacial hydrological networks; the coupling of ice sheets, climate and life; the tectonic settings; and the role of biogeochemical cycles in sustaining life in these harsh environments. The SALE-UNITED research and exploration program will span Antarctica in order to investigate subglacial lake environments of differing ages, evolutionary histories, and physical settings. These comparative studies will provide an holistic view of subglacial environments over millions of years and under differing climatic conditions. 

SALE-UNITED brings together 5 EoIs and coordinates its activities with an additional 30 or more EoIs including Gamburtsev Mountain exploration, major traverse projects and surveys, studies of climate change across the poles, and characterizations of polar ecosystems. Each of these programs will inform and contribute to the accomplishment of the scientific objectives of SALE-UNITED. SALE-UNITED's overarching objectives can only be realized by a coordinated program of exploration and research in multiple subglacial environments over many years. The wished for outcomes cannot be achieved by a single nation or program. Each component of SALE-UNITED will be an independently managed campaign with specific scientific objectives, logistical requirements, and management structures. Individual programs benefit from sharing resources, experiences, expertise, logistics and technologies. 

SALE-UNITED will be lead by an International Science and Technology Steering Committee (ISTSC). The ISTSC will form topical committees as needed to address major scientific and technological challenges. Standing Committees for Technology; Data and Information Management; and Education, Outreach and Communications (EOC) will be formed. SALE-UNITED will adhere to the SCAR Communications Plan, Capacity Building Strategy and Data Management Practices and Policies. Individual SALE-UNITED projects will adhere to their national standards for data management, access, and archive. A SALE Program Office and web site have been established and will serve as a focal point for information dissemination and as a data portal.

SALE-UNITED will adhere to the ICSU/WMO data policies and actively participate in all ICSU/WMO EOC activities. The ISTSC will include the leaders of national SALE programs and be augmented by international experts. The development, implementation and promotion of environmentally benign procedures for subglacial lake environment exploration and research programs will be a key guiding principle of SALE-UNITED exploration and research. SALE-UNITED will assist technology development and exchange while promoting environmental

Science Objectives:
 -Describing the airflow, mass and the moisture fields in East Coast
   winter storms with special emphasis on mesoscale and air-sea interaction
   processes contributing to cyclogenesis.
 -Understanding the physical mechanisms controlling the formation and
   rapid development of East Coast storms.
 -Developing and testing numerical models for the prediction of East Coast
   storms.
Project Description:
     The Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment (GALE) was an extensive study
of the atmospheric processes involved in the development of winter storms
on the East Coast of the United States.  GALE was originally initiated in
September 1982 by a group of university scientists representing Drexel
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, North Carolina State
University, State University of New York and the University of Washington.
This project was mainly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF),
Office of Naval Research (ONR), National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Other
contributors included the Army Research Office and the Corps of Engineers, Air
Force Office of Scientific Research, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
the Department of Energy (DOE).  Local support was supplied by the
Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority and Army Reserve National Guard and by the
North Carolina State University Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences.  The field phase of GALE was conducted from 15 January through 15
March 1986.  The GALE Operations Center was located at Raleigh-Durham Airport
with the main observing network deployed throughout Virginia, the Carolinas,
Georgia and the Atlantic coastal waters.  The GALE project office is located at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colorado.  The
experiment was designed to focus on three areas: the Inner, Regional and Outer
GALE areas.  The Inner GALE area, 500 km wide, was centered on the coast and
extended 1000km from Virginia to Georgia.  It examined for convection, boundary
layer fluxes and micro-physical processes.  The Regional GALE area, which was
1000km wide from the Appalachian Ridge to 500km offshore and stretched 1500km
from Florida to New Jersey, was studied for cyclogenesis and frontogenesis.  The
Outer GALE area extended from the Great Plains to east of the Regional area and
from New England to the Gulf of Mexico, with synoptic features of cyclones and
jet stream circulations being the main points of interest.
Data Sources:
     The GALE observing region covered the eastern half of the United
States in order to incorporate continental and marine effects.  Data was
collected west of the Appalachians in order to evaluate the orographic
effect on modifying large-scale systems or establishing mesoscale systems.
Data was also collected near the coast and offshore where cyclogenesis
occurs; consequently this was the main area of interest.  Rawinsonde
observations were supplied by the National Weather Service (NWS) and NCAR
along with dropwindsondes from NOAA measuring standard meteorological
parameters (temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction).
Meteorological satellites GOES-6, NOAA-9, NOAA-6, DMSP F-6, DMSP F-7
and NIMBUS-7 were available to provide radiance measurements.  Surface
observations were taken from a special GALE ground-station network (PAM,
Portable Automated Mesonet), NOAA buoys and platforms, micro-met towers,
military stations, lightning detectors, current meters and tide gauges to
measure standard parameters along with rainfall, sea surface temperature (SST)
and sea-level height.  Two research vessels, the Cape Hatteras and the
Endeavor, patrolled the waters off the North and South Carolina coasts
respectively, collecting surface and atmospheric sounding data as well as SST
and sub-surface data.  NOAA, NASA and NCAR aircraft gathered measurements of
air motion, cloud physics, air chemistry and thermodynamics in the boundary
layer.  The NWS provided a standard radar network while NASA, NOAA, NCAR, MIT
and the University of Washington supplied a doppler-radar network to measure
air motions and distribution of precipitation.

Informal learning environments of children's museums are fertile frontiers for communicating the excitement and significance of Polar scientific research to the public in both non-polar and traditional polar nations. Children's museums are also effective venues to enhance public understanding of the global dimensions of the issues facing the Polar Regions in the coming decades. By forming an international Go Polar! network of children's museums in non-polar nations (in Amsterdam, Osaka, Mexico City, Tel Aviv, Vienna, Melbourne, Caracas, Lisbon), as well as in traditional polar nations of Canada (Calgary and Toronto) and the United States (Indianapolis and San Francisco), we propose to deliver a multi-dimensional informal science education program about the Arctic and Antarctic to children under the age of 12 (and the adults who care for them). 

Our specific proposal, as part of the broad IPY outreach effort, is to: 

1) Adapt already existing Go Polar! Festival programming for use in museums of the Go Polar! network, complete with turnkey materials, including our patented Polar Puzzle, a unique floor interactive, educational displays and activities including specially developed teaching guides with sample scripts in the language appropriate to the particular museum; 

2) Adapt already existing Go Polar! Arctic Discovery Boxes for use in museums of the Go Polar! network, complete with turnkey materials, displays and including specially developed teaching guides with sample scripts in the appropriate languages; and 

3) Conduct training programs for teachers and museum staffs in the Go Polar! network in order that the Go Polar! informal science educational materials and programming can be used effectively during IPY and for years to come. 

The existing Go Polar! informal science educational materials and programming are made possible through a University-Museum partnership funded by the US National Science Foundation in 2003 to develop Go Polar! Cool Science in the Arctic (ESI-0336928). This unique partnership between the EdVenture Children Museum, the largest children's museum in the southeastern US, and the University of South Carolina, the State's largest research university, involved active Arctic researchers, university undergraduate students, the EdVenture museum staff, family education specialists, and educational psychologists to disseminate on-going NSF funded research on the Arctic hydrologic cycle (ODP-0229737). 

The Go Polar program provided opportunities for South Carolina children and families to meet real scientists engaged in Arctic research with hands-on activities that introduced children and families not only to the scientific process but also to new science concepts and knowledge. The Go Polar program also resulted in the development and testing of Arctic Discovery Boxes - specially designed informal education activities on three themes - #1 The Arctic and Global Change, #2 Arctic Cultures and #3 Animal Adaptations in the Arctic. Each Discovery box contains six interrelated hands-on activities with teaching guides and scripts. In 2005 the Go Polar! partnership expanded the reach of their programming and materials to include the Antarctic. Using the theme "Exploring and Connecting the Opposite Ends of the Earth" the Go Polar! team created a Polar Festival featuring a giant floor puzzle of the Arctic and Antarctic with the ocean basins and surrounding continents connecting the poles. With orchestrated play, the children are guided through diverse hands-on, minds-on learning experiences including an Arctic Village, an Aurora Theatre, mapping the earth with NASA satellites, migration in the air and sea, ozone, permafrost, and more. Special take home activities and a Polar Passport encourage further exploration at home and school.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=341
The IPY 2007-2008 provides a unique opportunity to create a human polar observatory and enhance our capacity to develop an innovative multinational and multidisciplinary Polar Health Surveillance System (PHSS) utilising synergies of existing national polar research programs, activities and data collection, and to coordinate the use of data from the PHSS to understand the biophysical, clinical, cultural, social and behavioural processes that shape the sustainability of circumpolar human societies (IPY Theme #6). We propose to use the PHSS to address the following questions:
" What physiological, psychosocial and clinical changes occur in humans temporarily resident and interacting with the extreme environment of Antarctica? 
" Are these changes comparable to those experienced in temporarily resident non-indigenous Arctic populations exposed to difficult environments? 
" How can we best prevent and treat any adverse effects of these changes? 
" How can this understanding enable us to improve healthcare, health and wellbeing of humans in Polar regions, in space and other extreme environments, and in humankind in general?

Activities during this period will include the utilization and enhancement of efficient smart, innovative eHealth and telemedicine technologies in the collection and support of this snapshot of human health during the IPY in polar regions.

The programme will provide an opportunity for students and scholars from a consortium of educational facilities, universities and research institutes to participate in the proposed research activities and acquire the experience and skills necessary to become the next generation of polar human biology and medicine researchers.

Once the comprehensive IPY science and operational plans are cemented in national programs, detailed flexible, modular and opportunistic human biology and medicine research planning will be possible, utilizing the various platforms including isolated polar communities, traverses and polar marine cruises. Subprojects utilizing or contributing to the PHSS based on nationally funded priorities will be coordinated by the research group and will include studies in the following domains of interest to Antarctic and Arctic researchers:
" Epidemiology
" Physiology
" Social and Behavioral Sciences (including anthropology, sociology, psychology, social geography and archival domains)
" Immunology
" Photo/Chronobiology
" Public health
" Nutrition
" Occupational health
" eHealth

Many of these subprojects have research modules currently in the field (e.g., Antarctic Multinational Psychology Research Project, Long Term Medical Survey) which will benefit greatly by increased participation and synergies of cross-analysis of datasets across nations, across disciplines and at both poles. Existing and new research modules utilizing new observational techniques will provide a unique opportunity to obtain a snapshot of polar health (leaving a legacy of data and health surveillance systems into the future

Examples of subprojects under consideration include the following:
1. Antarctic Multinational Psychology Research Project(PI Antonio Peri)
The AMPRP investigates the modifications of mood, subjective health complaints, coping strategies, interpersonal relationships occurring during a Antarctic winter campaign in groups of different nationalities.
2. Nutrition and Body Composition in Arctic(NuBCA) (PI Rosalba. Mattei)
Nutrition is a vital necessity and eating in an adequate way represents the fundamental step in order to assure health status. The aim of the study is to anticipate malnutrition that could be the cause of any reduction in physiology and psychological efficiency.
3. Long Term Medical Survey Concordia Station Antarctica
4. Concordia Station Study -Behavior, Coping, Group phenomenon, and psychosocial adaptation to isolation and confinement in a multicultural group combination of psychological, ethological and ethnographic methods. (PI E Rosnet)
The program deals with the psychosocial adaptation of a multicultural group in an isolated and confined environment. It will particularly be stressed on coping strategies and on social structure, social agreement, leadership and environmental affordances This second point will be studied toward complementary scientific approaches : psychological , ethological, and anthropological. The results will be related to the sociocultural background and the psychological characteristics of the participants and to the data of LTMS 
5. Svalbard Miner's Study (PI G Leon, H Ursin) 
6. GEOMED and others (PI Cermack). An interdisciplinary, multi-centre study to investigate the effects of the geomagnetic component of space weather on the parameters related to human health
7. Dome A East Antarctica Psychology and Physiology Studies(X. Quanfu PI) Investigation of seasonal changes in mood and hormonal profiles, including thyroid hormones, catecholamines, and cortisol.
8. Telemedicine respiratory system assessment and monitoring (PI S. Pillon)
9. Seasonal Activity Variations-Polar regions(SAV-PR) (PI G Steel)
Investigation of seasonal psychological patterns, activity levels and arousal impacting deployments of polar sojourners in both Arctic and Antarctic.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Sulfur dioxide emissions (SO2) impact human health, ecosystems, agriculture, and global and regional climate. Anthropogenic emissions have resulted in greatly increased sulfur deposition and atmospheric sulfate loadings near most industrialized areas. Sulfur dioxide forms sulfate aerosols that have a significant effect on global and regional climate. Historical reconstructions of sulfur dioxide emissions are necessary to access the past influence of sulfur dioxide on the earth system and as base-year information for future projections. This data set provides annual estimates of anthropogenic global and regional sulfur dioxide emissions spanning the period 1850–2005 using a bottom-up mass balance method, calibrated to country-level inventory data. Emissions by source category (coal, petroleum, biomass combustion, smelting, fuel processing, and other processes) are available for 142 countries and regions. For the purpose of viewing the data pattern and changes, the maps of total emissions in 1970–2005 are also provided for online view and download in the archive.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition 18</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
    Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
    Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
    proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
    JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
    Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
    JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
    Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
    JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
    transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
    Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
    Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
    meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
    oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
    terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
    board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
    meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
    and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
    in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
    of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
    39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
    Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
    from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
    and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
    established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
    through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
    70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
    southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
    members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
    making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
    atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
    occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
    glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
    December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
    Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
    of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
    have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
    station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
    meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
    Mountains. However, year-round observations including
    meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
    atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
    1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
    Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
    established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
    sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
    observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
    Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
    important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
    accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
    Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
    protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
    Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
    and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
    Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
    monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
    glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
    as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
    population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
    and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
    compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
    occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
    change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
    described in the previous chapter.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">For some 40 years, ISRIC – World Soil Information has been providing significant support to the international science community by collecting and archiving regional-, national- and global-scale maps of soils and land resources.

Despite effective procedures for storage and maintenance, most organizations involved in archiving struggle to arrest the deterioration of paper maps and the quality of information they contain. Deterioration occurs for various reasons that include handling, transport, exposure to light, moisture and atmospheric pollution.

Realizing the need to conserve the information on existing maps, which underpin the fast-developing thematic mapping strategies to support soil protection, the Institute of Environment and Sustainability (IES) in the European Commission (Italy) and ISRIC – World Soil Information initiated the European Digital Archive of Soil Maps (EuDASM). The immediate objective is to transfer soil information into digital format, with the maximum resolution possible, to preserve the information of paper maps that are vulnerable to deterioration.

Beyond data rescue, the archive is expected to develop into a common platform for storing soil maps from around the world and making the information readily accessible. Organisations that maintain soil map archives in paper form, and wishing to conserve this information by transferring it into digital form, are invited to join the EuDASM programme.

The initiative for this programme was taken by Dr Luca Montanarella of the European Joint Research Centre and Dr Otto Spaargaren of ISRIC – World Soil Information in October 2004. The first level success for this initiative was figured out by completion of the around 2000 soil maps pertaining to the African continent. Through this digitization programme the map quality and precision of information were preserved against further loss assuming to be required for future use by land resources specialists.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=295

The goal of this project is to make scholarly writing about the North more accessible to the general public, in both the North and the South. The scale of International Polar Year and the mass media attention that it will generate make this a perfect time to attract the general public to polar research. While many people are interested in the North, and aware of Northern issues in so much as they are presented in newspapers and on the evening news, such interested non-specialists do not have an obvious place to turn to get more detailed, in-depth information about Northern research. Our goal is to provide these people with a place to go for solid, complex information presented in an easy-to-read, accessible manner.

The Arctic Institute of North America, which houses the journal _Arctic_, is an ideal place to undertake this project. _Arctic_ is a leading multidisciplinary scholarly journal focusing on the North, which publishes quarterly for a largely academic audience. Many of its articles about science and culture in the North would have wide interest for a public audience, but the language and format in which they are presented is not designed for a non-academic audience. Similarly, the scientific papers in _Polar Research_ and the social sciences and humanites topics explored in _Etudes/Inuit/Studies_ have clear relevance for a larger audience base in both the North and the South. We believe that making the synopses of academic articles more user-friendly will inspire interested readers to pursue further knowledge about the North.

Each quarter, we will select two to three articles from _Arctic_, _Polar Research_, and _Etudes/Inuit/Studies_ for "popularization" and provide these synopses on the AINA website. By mounting these synopses on the Web and making them freely accessible, we are furthering that endeavour and significantly broadening our reach beyond that of a traditional subscriber-based print journal. We expect this site to become a one-stop portal for Northerners, media, and interested readers in the South.

A key aspect of the project will be to partner with other Canadian and international journals with a Northern focus to expand the service to a wider range of articles that are potentially of public interest. We have, for instance, contacted the editors of _Polar Record_ and _Northern Review_ to invite them to join us in this new project, and are awaiting their responses.

The project will also partner with Native organizations such as the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami to identify priority topics of interest to Northerners and assist with translation services in the appropriate language for each region covered by a given article. Ultimately, we would like to see links from Northern community groups' own websites to the AINA website to broaden interest and access to the article synopses.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
In the 1980's the world's space agencies initiated a long-term program
called the Earth Observing System (EOS) Mission to Planet Earth.  Its goal
is to obtain a better understanding of how the planet Earth functions and
how it changes with time, due to both natural and human-induced causes.
As part of this mission, the NBIOME (Northern Biosphere Observation and
Modelling Experiment) project was proposed and submitted to NASA by the
Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) in 1988.  It was approved as a
10 year program.

The project is a cooperative effort involving CCRS, Forestry Canada,
Agriculture Canada and a number of universities.  It has been accepted
as part of the Canadian Global Change Program co-ordinated by the Royal
Society of Canada.

NBIOME's principal objective is to increase our understanding of the role of
terrestrial vegetation in the total Earth system and its changes with time.
Its goal is to develop and adapt an observation system pertaining to a
family of landscape and ecosystem models, backed by process understanding,
to monitor, evaluate and predict the impact of global change on boreal
ecosystems including forests, grasslands, wetlands and tundra.
CCRS's contribution to NBIOME is to carry out the research, development
and demonstration of the use of satellite data to contribute to the
estimation of carbon pools and fluxes related to Canadian ecosystems.  The
remote sensing data is particularly valuable due to the broad spatial
distribution of vegetation and its inaccessibility at northern latitudes
where there are few settlements, limited road access and a short growing
season.

To achieve this goal an NBIOME Information System (NBIS) will be developed.
Its specific objectives will be:
     1.  To develop a Vegetation Classification Algorithm based on satellite
         measurements as a principal data source and, using this algorithm,
         to produce a digital vegetation map of Canada as a baseline for
         determining future changes as well as for use in growth and
         succession models.
     2.  To develop a Phytomass Model for the vegetation of Canada and, using
         this model, to produce a map of total phytomass as input into a
         growth model.
     3.  To develop/adapt a vegetation growth model and, using this model, to
         produce digital maps of Canada showing gross primary productivity
         and net change in carbon storage for different years within the EOS
         time period.
     4.  To develop/adapt one or more Succession Models and, using these
         models, to produce digital maps of future vegetation distribution
         of Canada based on the extrapolation of observed trends and/or
         likely postulated scenarios of future climatic conditions.

The Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML) investigates the distribution and abundance of Antarctica's marine biodiversity, how it is affected by climate change, and how change will alter the nature of the ecosystem services currently provided by the Southern Ocean for the benefit of mankind.

The CAML is a five-year project that will focus the attention of the public on the ice-bound oceans of Antarctica during the International Polar Year (IPY) in 2007/08. Its objective is to study the evolution of life in Antarctic waters, to determine how this has influenced the diversity of the present biota, and to use these observations to predict how it might respond to future change. The CAML will collaborate with biological oceanographers in its work, for at its heart lies the integrated nature of ecological and biological change.

Polar regions experience greater rates of climate change than elsewhere on the planet. The fauna of the regions are uniquely adapted to the extreme environments in which they exist, and may be vulnerable to shifts in climate. There is an urgent need to establish the state of these communities, and in particular their biodiversity, if we are to understand the impact of climate change. The project will integrate knowledge across all regions, biomes, habitats and fields of study to strengthen our knowledge of ecosystem dynamics in this high latitude, frozen ocean system. Only through a multi-scale level of investigation will a better understanding of the diversity and status of Antarctica's marine life be obtained.

The CAML's main biodiversity data will be collected from 17 research vessels during the IPY. In addition, tourist vessels will contribute observations and other ships will collect samples using the Continuous Plankton Recorder. The biodiversity data, collected as georeferenced species records, will available on the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research's Marine Biodiversity Information Network (SCAR-MarBIN http://www.scarmarbin.be) for researchers, governments and others concerned with ocean management.

The CAML will leave legacy sites for future comparability studies. It will employ modern genomic techniques and contribute to the Barcode of Life project, integrating with other Census projects. In particular, the CAML will interact very strongly with the Arctic Ocean Diversity Project (ArcOD), drawing comparisons between differences in ecological structure and dynamics between the Arctic and Southern Oceans.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In all colonial pinnipeds studied, mother-young vocal recognition exists and allows rapid and reliable meetings in spite of the confusing environment of the breeding colony. The efficiency of this recognition process guarantees pup survival, especially in species where females alternate foraging sea trips and lactation periods on land. The Atlantic Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) is a highly gregarious pinniped with females attending their calves for an extended period of time (2-3 years). Although we expect mother-calf vocal recognition to occur in this species due to the high density of individuals packed in herds, it has never been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we assessed the individual stereotypy of both mother and calf barks recorded in the wild by measuring frequency and temporal acoustic parameters. Both discriminant function and artificial neural network analyses resulted in high correct classification rates, underlying a well-defined individual stereotypy in parameters related to frequency modulation and frequency values. Playback experiments showed that mothers were more responsive to the barks of their own calf than to those of unrelated young. Finally, propagation experiments revealed that barks propagate at greater distances over water surface than over ice, acoustic features such as frequency modulation and frequency spectrum being highly resistant to degradation during propagation. Thus, acoustic analysis and propagation experiments suggest that these frequency parameters might be the key acoustic features involved in the individual identification process. This experimental study clearly demonstrates that Atlantic walrus has developed a highly reliable mother-calf vocal communication allowing such strong social bond.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
CALIPSO was selected as an Earth System Science Pathfinder satellite
mission in December 1998 to address the role of clouds and aerosols in
the Earth's radiation budget. NASA Langley Research Center is leading
the mission and is providing overall project management, systems
engineering, payload mission operations, data validation, processing
and archival. CNES is providing a PROTEUS spacecraft, the imaging
infrared radiometer (IIR), payload-to-spacecraft integration, and
spacecraft mission operations. CALIPSO is being developed through
collaboration between NASA and the French space agency, Centre
National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).

CALIPSO will fly a three-channel lidar and passive instruments to
provide key measurements of aerosol and cloud properties needed to
improve climate predictions. CALIPSO is co-manifested with the
CloudSat satellite for a October 2004 launch on a Delta II launch
vehicle. They both will operate as part of a constellation of
satellites including EOS Aqua, EOS Aura, and PARASOL (Polarization and
Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with
Observations from a Lidar), which is being developed by CNES. The
satellites of the constellation will fly in a 705-km circular
sun-synchronous polar orbit with a nominal ascending node equatorial
crossing time of 13:30 local time. This constellation will provide
nearly simultaneous and co-located observations that will allow
numerous synergies to be realized by combining CALIPSO observations
with complementary observations from other platforms. This unique data
set of aerosol and cloud optical and physical properties and
aerosol-cloud interactions will substantially increase our
understanding of the climate system and the potential for climate
change.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Circumpolar Population Monitoring</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Climate change is already dramatically affecting the biosphere, but its effects on biological communities are still poorly understood. Because of the sensitivity of sea ice extent to temperature fluctuation, and the sensitivity of high-latitude species to changes in ice extent, the Southern Ocean represents a natural laboratory in which to investigate the impacts of global and regional climate change and any consequent biotic modifications. In the Southern Ocean, individual species depending on their link to sea ice may be affected independently, or there may be changes due to complex, multispecies interactions, e.g. bottom-up cascades from plankton to krill, fish and top-predators; conversely, top-down cascades could result from alterations of predation pressure as changing sea ice affects the degree of access of top predators to their prey. In this context, it is now well documented that, among air-breathing top-predators, variations in penguin population can be used as an indicator of climatic changes. The census of penguin populations over several decades and all around the continent has indeed revealed general long-term trends, some of which appear to be contradictory depending on spatial scale. For example, the West Antarctic Peninsula show trends that differ from those observed in the Ross Sea and elsewhere. Furthermore, colonies at the regional scale, such as the South Orkney Islands, can also show contrasting population trajectories. It has been found that small colonies respond more dramatically to the altered environment than larger ones, a response affected by the proximity of neighbouring colonies and their respective size. In other words, some of the fundamental mechanisms driving the dynamics of penguin populations still remain largely unidentified. A long-term monitoring of individual birds using methods that minimize disturbance is therefore necessary to determine the life-history parameters that respond to climate change, such as survival, emigration, breeding performance and foraging success as well as metapopulation dynamics (clusters of colonies). It is also critical to ascertain that the differences within and between colonies are not due to an experimental bias. A co-ordinated effort, therefore, is required in the monitoring and analysis at different sites, both in following individuals over the complete breeding season and in tracking them at sea where they feed The main goal of this project is precisely to address these issues. This will be carried out in the context of other IPY projects that have related objectives and in the context of existing long-term monitoring programmes that are already well established. These include the Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML) IPY EoI 83, Integrated Analyses of Circumpolar Climate Interactions and Ecosystem Dynamics in the Southern Ocean (ICED) IPY 417, and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). We propose:

1. To define and use a population monitoring protocol for land-based top-predators that allows us to obtain large, quantitative sample sizes of year-round biological information about their breeding performance and at-sea activity and distribution with minimum disturbance for the population studied. This challenging task is feasible because of the major advances in microelectronics that have occurred over recent years. Our project will combine state-of-art electronic identification of individuals with the most-advanced bio-logging approaches. To minimize disturbance, the identification of animals requires that individuals are tagged with miniature passive implanted transponder microchips that are detected by radio receiver antennae (Automatic Identification System, AIS). This will be complemented by the bio-logging approach, which is based on externally-attached, miniature data-recorders that monitor the location, time-budget and/or feeding activity of free ranging animals.
2. To co-ordinate and standardize the monitoring and analysis procedures used by different research groups so as to provide a circumpolar network of information on the status of penguin populations, an activity to further the goals of CCAMLR. This will include promoting the development of automatic systems to monitor penguin populations at sites not yet monitored and to provide assistance to research groups that do not yet have the expertise or resources in this domain.
3. To share information on the population dynamics of penguins in relation to environmental variability (especially sea-ice) with: a) lead IPY projects (e.g. CAML EoI 83 and ICED EoI 417); b) other research groups investigating biological variability at other levels in the food chain (e.g. fish IPY EoI 248); and with d) a wider audience through media links and through internet-related links, including e) graduate and undergraduate students whose majors are related to Antarctic topics (e.g. through courses and lectures given at the International Antarctic Institute: http://www.iai.utas.edu.au/).

The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) of the U.S. Fish &amp;
Wildlife Service produces information on the characteristics,
extent, and status of the Nation?s wetlands and deepwater
habitats. The National Wetlands Inventory Center information is
used by Federal, State, and local agencies, academic
institutions, U.S. Congress, and the private sector. The NWIC
has mapped 90 percent of the lower 48 states, and 34 percent of
Alaska. About 44 percent of the lower 48 states, and 13 percent
of Alaska are digitized. Congressional mandates require the NWIC
to produce status and trends reports to Congress at ten-year
intervals. In addition to status and trends reports, the NWIC
has produced over 130 publications, including manuals, plant and
hydric soils lists, field guides, posters, wall size resource
maps, atlases, state reports, and numerous articles published in

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Global Soil Wetness Project</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      Overview

The Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP) is an ongoing modeling activity
of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project
(ISLSCP), a contributing project of the Global Energy and Water Cycle
Experiment (GEWEX). The GSWP is charged with producing a 2-year global
data set of soil moisture, temperature, runoff, and surface fluxes by
integrating one-way uncoupled land surface process models (LSPs) using
externally specified surface forcings and standardized soil and
vegetation distributions, namely, the ISLSCP Initiative I CD-ROM
data. Approximately one dozen participating LSP groups in five nations
have taken the common ISLSCP forcing data to execute their
state-of-the-art models over the 1987-1988 period to generate global
data sets.

Results of the pilot phase suggest that the GSWP framework is very
useful and valuable for assessing and developing land surface models
on a global scale with relatively little computational expense, and to
investigate questions of land surface hydrology and land-atmosphere
interaction.


      Motivation:

The motivation for GSWP stems from the paradox that soil wetness is an
important component of the global energy and water balance, but it is
unknown over most of the globe. Soil wetness is the reservoir for the
land surface hydrologic cycle, it is a boundary condition for
atmosphere, it controls the partitioning of land surface heat fluxes,
affects the status of overlying vegetation, and modulates the thermal
properties of the soil. Knowledge of the state of soil moisture is
essential for climate predictability on seasonal-annual time
scales. However, soil moisture is difficult to measure in situ, remote
sensing techniques are only partially effective, and few long-term
climatologies of any kind exist.

      Goals:

The goals of GSWP are fourfold. The project will produce
state-of-the-art global data sets of soil moisture, surface fluxes,
and related hydrologic quantities. It is a means of testing and
developing large-scale validation techniques over land. It serves as a
large-scale validation and quality check of the ISLSCP Initiative I
data sets. GSWP is also a global comparison of a number of LSPs, and
includes a series of sensitivity studies of specific parameterizations
which should aid future model development.

      Production:

The GSWP consists of three components: the Production Group, the
Validation Group, and the Inter-Comparison Center. The Production
Group consists of land surface modelers who conduct offline
integrations of land surface models over a global 1 degree grid for
1987-1988 using prescribed atmospheric forcing based on observations,
remote sensing and analyses. Each member of the production group
produces global time-mean and instantaneous fields of surface energy
and water balance terms three times per month using his/her LSP. These
data are produced in a standard format and sent to the
Inter-Comparison Center. In addition, each model is used to perform
specific sensitivity studies. The sensitivity experiments are intended
to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in model parameters and
forcing fields on simulation of the surface water and energy balances.

A number of different sensitivity studies were conducted by members of
the Production team. Perhaps the most significant general conclusion
that can be drawn from the studies is that sub-grid scale variability
in infiltration, whether due to heterogeneity in soil properties or
the distribution of rainfall within a grid box, has a significant
impact on the simulation of runoff. Variations in vegetation
properties, the vertical structure of the soil, and radiation seem to
have less of an impact on simulations. These results suggest that some
sort of accounting for sub-grid heterogeneity, whether through an
explicit modeling of small tiles or a statistical approach, is
necessary to properly partition surface water between runoff and
evapotranspiration.


      Validation:

There is also a Validation Group which assembles data sets and
coordinates studies to validate the global products, either directly
(by comparison to field studies or soil moisture measuring networks)
or indirectly (e.g. use of modeled runoff to drive river routing
schemes for comparison to streamflow data). The soil wetness data
produced are being tested within a general circulation model (GCM) to
evaluate their quality and their impact on seasonal to interannual
climate simulations. The Winand Staring Center has volunteered to lead
the validation process.


The validation effort allows some other important conclusions to be
drawn about the quality of the GSWP results. The use of the soil
moisture product as a specified boundary condition improves the
forecast ability of a climate model. This is most likely as a result
of mitigating the effects of poor rainfall simulations on the surface
water balance of the climate model. Secondly, comparison with
observations in more detail still point to significant problems in the
way the LSPs deal with soil moisture, or more generally, land surface
hydrology. Yet, it is clear that the quality of the land surface model
simulations are critically dependant on the quality of the land
surface data (soils, vegetation, terrain, radiative parameters) and
the meteorological forcing data.


      Inter-Comparison:

An Inter-Comparison Center (ICC) has been established at the Center
for Climate System Research, University of Tokyo for evaluating and
comparing data from the different models. Comparison among the model
results is used to assess the uncertainty in estimates of surface
components of the moisture and energy balances at large scales, and as
a quality check on the model products themselves.  The ICC is also the
community re-distribution point for the data produced in GSWP.


The inter-comparison effort has shown that there is a large spread
among the participating LSPs in terms of their partitioning of surface
energy between latent and sensible heat flux, and of water between
runoff and evapotranspiration. Most of the LSPs underestimated
basin-scale runoff, possible due to the GSWP specification of the
treatment of convective precipitation. Nonetheless, validation of the
consensus runoff against streamflow data show that the LSPs as a group
perform quite well where sufficient gauge-based precipitation forcing
data were available, and performed poorly where gauges are sparse.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">2005 Field season: During 1-10 February, the RV Ernest surveyed over 275 n. mi. collecting acoustic backscatter data. At the same time, the RV Yuzhmorgeologiya completed nearly three passes through the nearshore-to-shelf-break survey grid. Stations throughout the survey were occupied at night where CTD and net tow stations were conducted. Also included in this field season were preliminary  ... tests of a AUV (Fetch I, Sias-Patterson) which was deployed to conduct bathymetry mapping and determine whether krill swarms could be detected by the vehicle. The AUV work was conducted with Dr. Mark Patterson of VIMS and Sias-Patterson and the Advanced Survey Technologies group at SWFSC led by Dr. David Demer. Except for a near gale which occurred exactly mid-way during the survey period, good weather allowed for extensive survey effort. In addition, instrumented buoys were deployed to test a new engineering design of the buoys used in previous field seasons. Due to technical issues, only limited data were collected during the buoy deployment.

2006 Field season: During 1-10 February, the RV Ernest surveyed over 264 n. mi. collecting acoustic backscatter data. At the same time, the RV Yuzhmorgeologiya completed two passes through the nearshore-to-shelf-break survey grid. Stations throughout the survey were occupied at night where CTD and net tow stations were conducted. An additional small vessel (RV Roald) was deployed with a SIMRAD MS 20 Multibeam echosounder to map bathymetry of the nearshore area and to study krill swarm characteristics. Joint operations (specific survey lines) were conducted with all three vessels). Poor weather and sea state conditions resulted in the loss of two days of survey effort at the beginning and 1 day at the end of the period. We still managed to conduct a comparable amount of survey effort as in 2005 due to few (if any) equipment or vessel malfunctions. Instrumented buoys were deployed and collected data over several days of the survey period.

2007 Field season: During 28 January to 1 February, the RV Ernest surveyed approximately 55 n.mi. collecting acoustic backscatter data. At the same time, the RV Yuzhmorgeologiya completed slightly more than one pass through the nearshore-to-shelf-break survey grid. Stations throughout the survey were occupied at night where CTD and net tow stations were conducted. An additional small vessel (RV Roald) was deployed with a SIMRAD MS 20 Multibeam echosounder to map bathymetry of the nearshore area and to study krill swarm characteristics. Joint operations (specific survey lines) were conducted with the two smaller vessels).The shorter survey period during this field season was a combination of several factors: reduced shiptime for the AMLR survey due to NOAA budgetary constraints (10 day survey period reduced to 7 days) and a combination of weather delays during the AMLR broad area survey and problems with the calibration of the RV Yuzhmorgeologiya echosounder system (7 to 5 days). In addition, during our reduced survey window, we experienced extremely poor weather and dangerous sea conditions which forced us to remain on shore and also damaged equipment when we did venture out. Despite these conditions, we were able to collect data from all three research vessels (Ernest, Roald, Yuzhmorgeologiya) to provide a 3rd year of data for this project. One instrumented buoy was deployed at the start of the nearshore survey period and collected data throughout the survey period.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Cold Land Processes in the Northern Hemisphere: Regional and Global Climate and Societal-Ecosystem Linkages and Interactions</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Rationale: The stability of the ecosystems in more than a half of Northern Eurasia and north North America (in Cold Land Regions, CLR) relies on the stability of seasonal snow cover and ice that, so far, holds these ecosystems together. Breach of this stability affects societies and economic activity in high latitudes. Currently, changes in terrestrial cryosphere are among the strongest contemporary environmental changes. However, these changes as well as their associated feedbacks and impacts are still inadequately described within the contemporary Earth System Models. During the 20th century, we observed snow cover and glaciers’ retreat and permafrost thaw affecting water supply, land cover, and the carbon cycle. Glacier wastage has affected sea level rise, water freshening, sea ice reduction, bioproductivity changing, and redistributing gravity field patterns. Further consequences are difficult to predict. Paleodata, instrumental observations, and model simulations of future climate changes suggest significant and rapid changes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and land cover occur in high latitudes particularly over the CLR. It is critical to develop the ability to measure, monitor, and model the processes that will provide the possibility for accurate future projections of climatic and environmental changes in these regions because these changes have the potential to impact the Global Earth System and human society. We need (a) to understand how the changes in these regions affect regional and global biogeochemical, surface energy and water cycles, as well as human societies and how to develop the capability to predict changes to support global projections, informed decision making, and numerous applications in these regions; (b) to establish (restore, develop, utilize) an observational system to retrieve and properly interpret information about the current state and changes of the environment in the CLR; (c) assess their interactions with global climate and society; and (d) enhance the predictive capability of Earth System models to account for environmental changes over the Northern Hemisphere and the globe.

The overarching science question of this IPY activity is: How do terrestrial cryosphere dynamics in the Northern Hemisphere interact with and alter the biosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere of the Earth?
The Science question dictates the following research strategy: We have to define first (a) what deficiencies currently exist in understanding the major processes in cold land regions? (b) what are the major sources of uncertainties? (c) what information is needed to run (and/or develop) sufficiently complete models that describe these processes? Thereafter, targeted field campaigns, data gathering /recovery, and/or new networks should be initiated.

Within the triad: observations, process studies, and modeling, the role of Process Studies in Cold Land Regions is to improve models that reproduce the changes in the Earth System behavior in response to the changes in high latitudes. Currently existing models do not describe sufficiently well the critical processes of interactions and their dynamics within terrestrial ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, coastal zone, and cryosphere in CLR. Also, the initial state of some of components of the Earth System in the Regions (e.g., the cryosphere) is not yet well known. We need to justify both the innovative research and efforts to improve observations in the region that otherwise could be ineffective investments in old technology and practices.

Three terrestrial components of the cryosphere in the CLR of the Northern Hemisphere: snow cover, permafrost, and small glaciers will be studied as well as their interactions with society and potential feedbacks to the Global Earth System. Within each area of research the foci of studies will be on (a) the models’ development to improve understanding and projections of the dynamics of the Earth System in high latitudes and its interactions with the Global Earth System and (b) creation of conditions for seamless implementation of these models (e.g., organizing the input data stream for them) in a quest of answering the overarching science question and serving numerous practical applications.

Tasks for snow cover studies. Major issues: (a) Global Earth System modeling and numerous applications require high resolution global snow water equivalent measurements, their extension in the past, and a proper physical description of processes describing snow dynamics; (b) Having a new Cold Land Processes Mission (CLPM) as a long-term objective, the IPY is the right time for extensive and focused groundwork to secure the Mission success. Tools: (a) Extensive field campaigns and network legacy to guaranty the CLPM calibration and ongoing support over the Hemisphere; (b) Studies of compatibility of various (in-situ and remote) instrumentation and data rescue efforts; (c) Development of a portable (scalable) physically based model of short-term and seasonal snow evolution applicable to rough terrain and/or in the presence of vegetation.

Tasks for permafrost studies. Major issue: Permafrost changes (warming and thawing) have global consequences =&gt; these processes should be well understood, monitored, modeled, and projected. Mitigation strategies should be timely developed. Tools: (a) Establish and support a comprehensive permafrost monitoring system in the high latitudes including the Arctic coastal zone; (b) Develop reliable models accounting for changes in the permafrost and its interactions with terrestrial ecosystems, hydrology, atmosphere, and society and incorporate them into emerging global Earth System and reanalyses models; (c) Develop specialty models that seamlessly account for specifics of permafrost environment in practical applications (coastal erosion, cold land engineering, etc.)

Tasks for glaciers’ studies. Major issues: Increase in accuracy of monitoring of glaciers' dynamics from space and in situ observations to resolve the major uncertainties of the global glaciers' changes, first of all surface area and distribution versus elevation and surface mass balance with extrapolation from the observational network to the larger glacier systems. Tools: (a) Develop a conceptual model for areal generalization of the glaciers’ characteristics and their monitoring; (b) Develop a portable model that describes the processes of glaciers’ change in response to climate change; the model should be useable as a block in the regional and global climate models as well as for water and natural hazard management; (c) Repeat regular monitoring using laser altimetry for glaciers in CLR and blending these observations with existing long-term observational network data; (d) Assessment of direct anthropogenic impact on glaciers’ dynamics (e.g., due to air pollution). Mostly small glaciers of the Northern Hemisphere will be studied within this IPY proposal.

Tasks for socio-economic studies. Major issue: Fragile environment and harsh climatic conditions in high latitudes put additional stress on societal sustainability during rapid environmental changes. Tools: (a) Determine the impacts of environmental changes in high latitudes on humans in particular on the indigenous population; (b) Develop models of economic effect, both positive and negative, of the ongoing and possible climate changes, snow- glaciers- and permafrost-related hazards; (c) Develop the societal feedback loop models for use in Global Earth models; (d) Develop mitigation strategies for the populations negatively affected by contemporary and projected environmental changes.

Tasks for integration studies. Major issue: Need for suite of regional models that incorporate peculiarities of interactions of climate, cryosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere of high latitudes and serve as a reliable internal block to Global Earth Models. Tools: (a) Develop regional models (e.g., reanalysis, WRF, LDAS) with specialty blocks (hydrology, cold land, coastal processes, ecosystem, societal interactions) incorporating major feedbacks that are specific for high latitudinal land areas and are of global importance (e.g., potentially powerful permafrost thawing over CLR and the Arctic coastal zone – greenhouse gases emission positive feedback); (b) Develop (improve) regional numerical weather forecast models to account for specifics of the high latitudes (including specific societal needs); (c) Verify Global Climate Models’ projections in the high latitudes; (d) Organize input data stream (remote and in-situ) sufficient for operating the system that can answer the overarching science question and serve numerous practical applications.

Program Title: Eastern Regional Air Quality Study
The Eastern Regional Air Quality study (ERAQS) extended the
comprehensive aerometric measurements initiated under the Sulfate
Regional Experiment (SURE).  This was done with two major objectives
in mind:
1) To complete two years of continuous air quality data acquisition in
the northeastern United States in order to check seasonal and annual
variability of air pollutants and precursor materials and extend the
SURE data base.
2) To provide one full year of collocated aerometric and precipitation
chemistry data in the northeastern United States in order to define
any association between local air quality data and acidic deposition.
The nine Class I SURE stations were operated continuously for an
additional period of 14 months according to the protocols developed
for the SURE.  Simultaneously, collocated precipitation chemistry
samples were collected on a daily (event) basis.
See: "http://src.com/~epriasdc/eraqs/eraqs.htm" for information on
the ERAQS study.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The CETA program (Distribution des cétacés en Terre Adélie) was launched by the French Polar Institute (IPEV) in 2009 to carry out a first pilot study on cetacean distribution off Adelie Land (IWC Area V). An opportunistic survey conducted in January 2010 allowed the collection of 38 sightings on the continental shelf off the Adélie Land coastline, totalising a minimum of 84 individuals. True blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were identified for the first time in the Adélie Land region. Sightings of antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and killer whale (Orcinus orca) type A and C confirmed the presence of both species in this area. Photo-ID were realised on three blue whales and two humpback whales. One of the two humpback was previously photo-ID in Hervey Bay, East Australia in 2002. A biopsy was collected on one humpback whale. The presence of great whales (8 individuals of blue and humpback whales) in the Adélie Depression raised the issue of the importance of this area for such endangered species. The second year of this pilot study will be conducted in January 2011, after which data will combined to evaluate relative abundance of cetaceans in the region. This work is a part of the Southern Ocean Research Partnerships (SORP) on non-lethal whale research.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">AASE Mission Overview
      
NASA is addressing the crucial scientific issue of global ozone depletion. A major airborne campaign was planned and executed in August and September of 1987 to study the sudden and unanticipated decrease observed in the abundance of ozone over Antarctica in the Austral spring since 1979. Results from that study have provided data which directly implicate man-made chemical compounds, chlorofluorocarbons, in the enormous ozone loss over this remote region in the southern hemisphere. To continue the study of the production and loss mechanisms for ozone in the polar stratosphere and to assess man's growing influence on his environment, NASA is planning a follow-on experiment to the one conducted over the Antarctic. A second major aircraft-campaign is planned for January - February 1989. The recently published Ozone Trends Panel Report found that the largest decreases in total ozone occurred during January-February at latitudes near the edge of the Arctic vortex. This experiment!  will investigate the Arctic polar stratosphere from a base in Norway.
      
Objectives
     
The primary objectives of the 1989 Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition are:
      
To study the production and loss mechanisms of ozone in the north polar stratospheric environment.
      
To study the effect on ozone distribution of the Arctic polar vortex and of the cold temperatures associated with the formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC's).       

Approach
      
The Upper Atmospheric Research Program sponsored by the NASA Office of Space Science and Applications has supported the development of instrumentation specifically designed to measure trace species critical to the understanding of stratospheric photochemistry and dynamics. This airborne instrumentation has been flown in two previous experiments: the Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange Project and the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment. We propose to use the suite of instruments flown in these earlier experiments to address the objectives defined for the Arctic Ozone Expedition.  We propose to operate the ER-2 out of Stavanger, Norway (59 N, 5 degrees 38"E). We are planning 10 missions, each with a duration of 7 hours, allowing a range of about 20 degrees of latitude. The field experiment will last approximately 7-8 weeks from the last week of December 1988 through the middle of February 1989. This time period should allow us to make measurements during the statistically most active period for the formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds in the Arctic.
      
The DC-8 will be deployed for the same period of time as the ER-2, and while most of the flights will be closely coordinated with those of the ER-2, many flights will be quite independent. The data from the two aircraft will be complementary. Because of its limited range, the ER-2 will not be able to survey the entire Arctic region of interest, whereas the greater range of the DC-8 will enable it to survey the polar vortex and air processed through the cold temperature region of the polar vortex. The number of flights would be comparable to those of the ER-2; the prime operating site the same as the ER-2: Stavanger, Norway.
      
METEOROLOGICALLY GUIDED FLIGHT TRACKS
      
In addition to normal weather forecast products to aid in flight planning from the scientific point of view, the mission will have available forecasts of air parcel trajectories and potential vorticity maps, which can be used to follow the movement of air masses of interest, and to define the vortex dynamics.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">[Source: PRISM-RS Home Page, http://www.imber.info/index.php/Science/Endorsed-projects/PRISM-RS-November-2011 ]

The Ross Sea continental shelf is one of the most productive areas in the Southern Ocean, and may comprise a significant, but unaccounted for, oceanic CO2 sink, largely driven by phytoplankton production. The processes that control the magnitude of primary production in this region are not well understood, but data suggest that iron limitation is a factor. Field observations and model simulations indicate four potential sources of dissolved iron to surface waters of the Ross Sea:

    circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intruding from the shelf edge;
    sediments on shallow banks and nearshore areas;
    melting sea ice around the perimeter of the polynya;
    glacial meltwater from the Ross Ice Shelf.

The principal investigators hypothesize that hydrodynamic transport via mesoscale currents, fronts, and eddies facilitate the supply of dissolved iron from these four sources to the surface waters of the Ross Sea polynya. These hypotheses will be tested through a combination of in situ observations and numerical modeling, complemented by satellite remote sensing. In situ observations will be obtained during a month-long cruise in the austral summer. The field data will be incorporated into model simulations, which allow quantification of the relative contributions of the various hypothesized iron supply mechanisms, and assessment of their impact on primary production. The research will provide new insights and a mechanistic understanding of the complex oceanographic phenomena that regulate iron supply, primary production, and biogeochemical cycling. The research will thus form the basis for predictions about how this system may change in a warming climate.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment-2</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The ABLE missions have been designed specifically to study the rate of
exchange of material between the Earth's surface and its atmospheric
boundary layer, and the processes by which gases and aerosols are
moved between the boundary layer and the 'free' troposphere. These
expeditions are conducted in ecosystems of the world that are ... known to
exert a major influence on global atmospheric chemistry. In some
cases, these ecosystems are undergoing profound changes as a
consequence of natural processes and/or human impact.

The ABLE-2 project consisted of two expeditions: the first in the
Amazonian dry season (ABLE-2A, July-August 1985); and the second in
the wet season (ABLE-2B, April-May 1987). The ABLE-2 core research
data were gathered by NASA Electra aircraft flights that stretched
from Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon River, west to Tabatinga, on
the Brazil-Colombia border, from a base at Manaus in the heart of the
forest. These observations were supplemented by ground based chemical
and meteorological measurements in the dry forest, the Amazon
floodplain, and the tributary rivers through use of enclosures, an
instrumented tower in the jungle, a large tethered balloon, and
weather and ozonesondes.

This study showed air above the Amazon jungle to be extremely clean
during the wet season but deteroirated dramatically during the dry
season as the result of biomass burning, performed mostly at the edges
of the forest. Biomass burning is also a source of greenhouse gases
carbon dioxide and methane, as well as other pollutants (carbon
monoxide and oxides of nitrogen). Amazonian ozone deposition rates
were found to be 5 to 50 times higher than those previously measured
over pine forests and water surfaces. The Amazon River floodplain is
a globally significant source of methane, supplying about 12% of the
estimated worldwide total from all wetlands sources. Over Amazonia,
carbon monoxide is enhanced by factors ranging from 1.2 to 2.7 by
comparison with adjacent regions due to isoprene oxidation and biomass
burning. Over the rainforest individual convective storms transport
200 megatons of air per hour, of which 3 megatons is water vapor that
releases 100,000 megawatts of energy into the atmosphere through
condensation into rain.

The ABLE was a collaboration of U.S. and Brazilian scientists
sponsored by NASA and Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE)
and supported by the Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) component of
the NASA Tropospheric Chemistry Program.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Environmental Monitors on Lobster Traps</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The eMOLT project (http://www.emolt.org/) is a non-profit collaboration of
industry, science, and academics devoted to monitoring of the physical
environment of the Gulf of Maine and the Southern New England shelf.  In a
series of phases funded by the Northeast Consortium (2000-2005),  we have
developed low-cost strategies to measure bottom temperature and salinity and,
most recently, surface current velocity with the help of nearly 100 lobstermen 
dispersed along the entire New England coast.  We hope to extend our existing
multi-year time series (as well as our monitoring capabilities), continue
integration with the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS), and
contribute to whatever operational system is developed for our region in the
future.

The eMOLT partners currently include all the major lobstermen associations in
New England (Maine, Massachusetts, Downeast, and Atlantic Offshore), a NOAA
scientist, the Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation, and the Marine Science
Department at the Southern Maine Community College.  Having created this
network of participating fishermen, our primary goal is to supply these
individuals with the latest in low-cost instrumentation sufficient for
maintaining continuous time series of physical variables at fixed locations and
depths.  Our database now consist of 1.3 million hourly records of temperature,
80k hourly records of salinity, and 40k satellite drifter fixes.  While our
mission is primarily motivated by lobster science and the need to document
background conditions, we make our database accessible to the general public
and the recently-formed GoM Ocean Data Partnership in the form of web served
products and raw data (see www.emolt.org).

In our quest to minimize instrumentation cost, we have partnered with engineers
in the private sector to  develop devices that may be of interest to the
oceanographic community in general.  The first is a GPS drifter at nearly a
third the cost of conventional units that implements the SENS technology with
the GLOBALSTAR low-orbiting satellite system.  These units have already logged
more than 30 thousand kilometers of  ocean. Another is a real-time bottom
temperature sensor (attached to lobster traps) that wirelessly transmits data
to a shipboard system as it is hauled on deck.  Both of these units should be
commercially available in 2005.

We expect the primary users of eMOLT data, aside from the lobstermen
themselves, will be local ocean circulation modelers.  The need for data in
initialization, assimilation, and validation of their numerical simulations is
becoming more and more obvious.  The complex  time-varying nature of the Gulf
of Maine system calls for incorporating  as much data as possible in order to
generate realistic flow fields.  We hope to supplement the data supplied by 
GoMOOS by providing modelers with a extensive array of  bottom observations as
well as Lagrangian drifter tracks.  Our hope is that these numerical models
will someday help in our understanding of lobster larvae drift and the fate of
any particles for that matter, such as Harmful Algal Blooms, along our coast. 
What are the mechanisms that govern the both the short-term and long-term
variability of the GoM ecosystem and can we generate realistic, time-varying,
3-d simulations of these changes?

Our philosophy is that local fishermen already spend their days at sea,  have
the biggest stake in preserving our coastal marine resources, and are the most
knowledgeable of the local waters.  Their interest, curiosity, and enthusiasm
are sincere.  They should play an important part in our nation's Integrated
Ocean Observing Systems.

The main goal of the NOAA/CMDL Ocean/Atmosphere Exchange of Trace Compounds
(OAXTC) 1992 study was to determine the atmospheric mixing ratio of
hydrochlorofluorocarbon 22 (HCFC-22) and its partial pressure in
surface waters of the West Pacific Ocean to assess the possible
existence of an oceanic sink for this compound.
The ship, John V. Vickers, started out of Long Beach, CA, and reached
Dutch Harbor, AK, one week later. The cruise continued to a point
offshore of Kamchatka, Russia, Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands, and
finally ended in Noumea, New Caledonia, 12 weeks after it began.
CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), CFC-113 (CCl2FCClF2), methyl
chloroform (CH3CCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), nitrous oxide (N2O)
and HCFC-22 (CHClF2) were measured in the air and surface waters of
the Pacific Ocean between 55 deg N and 22 deg S during the late summer
and early fall of 1992. Atmospheric measurements of all gases agreed
well with results from NOAA fixed stations at similar latitudes.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP, http://www.igbp.kva.se)
is an interdisciplinary scientific activity established and sponsored by the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). The Programme was instituted
by ICSU in 1986, and the IGBP Secretariat was established at the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences in 1987.

The IGBP programme is focused on acquiring basic scientific knowledge about the
interactive processes of biology and chemistry of the Earth as they relate to
global change.  The goal of the programme is to describe and understand the
interactive physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the total
Earth system, the unique environment that it provides for life, the changes
that are occurring in this system, and the manner in which they are influenced
by human actions.

IGBP is composed of eleven program elements.  These are composed of eight
broadly discipline-oriented projects, called Core Projects, covering such
topics as atmospheric science, terrestrial ecology, oceanography, hydrology,
and links between the natural and the social sciences. Three Framework
Activities on data, modelling, and regional research, facilitate incorporating
scientific results into a holistic picture.  The detailed planning and
implementation of each Core Project is directed by a Scientific Steering
Committee, and the Framework Activities are each guided by a Scientific
Steering Committee or a Task Force.

Current and Past Core Projects:
-----------------------------
   Analysis, Integration and Modeling of the Earth System (AIMES)
   Biospheric Aspects of the Hydrologic Cycle (BAHC)

NACP Project Profile http://www.nacarbon.org/cgi-nacp/web/investigations/inv_pgp.pl?pgid=199

In tandem with the ongoing world-wide increase in the abundance of woody plants within former grasslands, desert grasslands throughout the southwestern U.S. have experienced a dramatic increase in the abundance of shrubs since the end of the 19th century. The region thus provides an adequate subject for the development of remote sensing and modeling methods which will be useful at global scales and in other regions. We propose to estimate carbon pools in this region using remotely-sensed inputs from the NASA Earth Observing System satellites Terra and Aqua. 


We are working to refine mapping of vegetation through improved plant community type differentiation, estimating contributions from soil, shrub and grass components and provision of structural measures. This addresses three aspects of the problem of estimating C pools: large differences in total C storage in different plant communities; the need to reliably estimate the areal proportions of soil, grass and shrubs; and the need to obtain measures of canopy structure over large areas. 


We are working towards these goals using multi-angle spectral reflectance data and derived parameters and metrics from the MISR and MODIS instruments. The approach is based on the premise that incorporating multi-angle measures in plant community type mapping results in substantial improvements in classification and mapping; that canopy heterogeneity is reflected in these data; and that useful canopy structure measures are available in the angular domain. 


From 2006, we began working at the regional scale and included maps of forest canopy parameters from MISR.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=88

This project makes use of the unique focus of IPY cooperation to synthesize, collect, analyze and produce comprehensive data sets on the spatial and temporal patterns of accumulation of snow and the perimeter discharge of ice from the Antarctic ice sheet. The work can be subdivided into three major activities, each requiring a distinctly different approach. 

1) Spatial and Temporal Pattern of Net surface Accumulation. Various successful ITASE traverses of the Antarctic over the past decade have begun the process of collecting high-frequency radar soundings that, when tied to dated ice cores, provide a continuous transect of accumulation history by following dated radar horizons. We will expand these observations in two ways: by encouraging the collection of more data as part of any IPY or post-IPY traverse across Antarctica including identifying commercially available equipment that can be used to begin standardizing the international data set; and by collecting additional data with an existing airborne high-frequency radar system flown in areas that both fill in major gaps in coverage and increase the number of intersecting transect tie-points. The distributed product from this activity will be a three-dimensional mapping of numerous isochrones that represent the spatial and temporal variability of Antarctic accumulation at an unprecedented level of detail. 

2) Position and Velocity at the Grounding Line. These will be determined exclusively from satellite data using proven techniques. Interferometric SAR analysis has already determined many segments of the grounding line and SAR data are presently being analyzed to determine surface ice velocity over the region north of 72S. Two other satellite data sets will assist in this analysis: Landsat data, made available through a planned map mosaicing activity, will be examined to help in the delineation of the grounding line and flow rate; and satellite altimetry will provide additional indications of the grounding line transition. These data provide an earlier epoch measurement. It is hoped that a new collection of interferometric quality SAR data will be part of IPY to allow a common epoch for the data sets of surface velocity and ice thickness. The comparison of this new velocity data with the previous large-scale mapping of ice speed, as well as a wealth of isolated older measurements, will provide useful indications of the temporal variation of ice discharge and grounding line position along large portions of the Antarctic's grounded perimeter. 

3) Ice Thickness at the Grounding Line. These data are required to complete the calculation of ice discharge. Our goal is to make direct measurements as nearly coincident with the flow measurements, as possible. This is a very challenging task. Negotiations are continuing in countries that have operational airborne ice penetrating radars that can measure ice thickness of more than one kilometer. Some other IPY programs (e.g., ACE, PET and GIGAGAP) have indicated a willingness to include needed measurements as part of their field program. Where new measurements are not possible during IPY, or perhaps immediately thereafter, older measurements will be used. There are many existing data sets for portions of the Antarctic perimeter - the largest being from the Italian program. Additionally, we will develop the means to use satellite altimetry (ICESat and possibly Cryosat) to provide more widely spaced measurements of ice thickness inferred from surface elevations on floating ice immediately adjacent to the grounding line.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: ORACLE-O3
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=99

The depletion of the polar ozone layer is one of the strongest anthropogenic signals in the earth system. The IPY will approximately take place during the period of peak concentrations of man-made ozone depleting substances in the region of the ozone layer. It is also the time when potential effects from climate change, e.g. changes in temperature, water vapour abundances, and/or circulation, might begin to manifest in the stratosphere and influence ozone recovery. In April 2005, nearly eighteen years after the signing of the Montreal Protocol (MP), ozone loss is as severe as ever over the Arctic, and the timing and extent of ozone recovery is uncertain. Depletion of stratospheric ozone in polar regions has greatly enhanced harmful UV radiation in the affected areas at times of the year when ecosystems are vulnerable. The state of the polar stratosphere, and its future development will be, therefore, a major source of concern, both for circumpolar communities and people living at lower latitudes in the International Polar Year (IPY) and for decades thereafter. 

The project will be divided into seven main activities: 

1) ozone loss (detection and impact on UV radiation, 
2) PSC (polar stratospheric clouds) and cirrus, 
3) atmospheric chemistry, 
4) UV radiation, 
5) ozone and climate change and feedback, 
6) data management, and 
7) education, outreach and communication.

The project implies precisely quantification of polar ozone losses in both hemispheres achieved with concerted international campaigns during which hundreds of ozonesondes will be launched in real-time coordination from station networks in the Arctic and Antarctic. Satellite coverage of ozone and ozone depleting substances will be unprecedented during the IPY, and data from satellites such as ENVISAT, Aura, ACE, Odin, POAM III and SAGE III will be used in a novel approach that combines these measurements with groundbased station data. 

Understanding ozone depletion requires an understanding of PSCs which are known to initiate ozone depletion through heterogeneous reactions and enhance ozone depletion through removal of nitric acid (denitrification) by cloud sedimentation. Chemical, microphysical, and optical properties of polar cloud particles and gas phase species will be obtained in-situ and remotely from stratospheric balloons and several aircraft, including the high altitude research aircraft Geophysica during a major Arctic field campaign. Complementary particle information will be gained by lidar observations from several Arctic and Antarctic NDSC (Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change) research stations, including the development of PSC detection capabilities with the satellite borne CALIPSO lidar.

During the project ground-based observations will be performed at many Arctic and Antarctic NDSC-stations by means of remote sensing instruments operating in the infrared, UV/Vis and microwave spectral regions to measure the seasonal and long-term variability of ozone, water vapour, and numerous key ozone-related trace gases in the stratosphere, in addition to tropospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, and biomass burning. Radiosonde, lidar and satellite will provide measurements of wind and temperatures in the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. The project also comprehends monitoring of UV-, visible, and infrared radiation and ground/sea/ice albedo in various high latitude stations in the northern and southern hemisphere together with modelling studies of ozone and UV in these regions, including an epidemiological study of personal UV exposure. 

Integration of field data and process studies within a modelling framework will enable predictions the future evolution of the ozone layer as well as the potential feedback on the future polar climate. The modelling efforts will focus on assimilating the observations to yield a comprehensive understanding that can both reproduce the observed circulation and chemical evolution and predict the Arctic and Antarctic middle atmosphere response to changes in the circulation and atmospheric chemistry. Atmospheric effects of manifestations of solar activity as the short-term changes of the cosmic ray intensity, variations of the interplanetary electric field and variations of the solar UV-irradiation will be included. Interactively coupled chemistry-climate models (CCMs) of the troposphere and the stratosphere will be used to investigate past and to assess future changes of climate and atmospheric chemical composition at higher geographical latitudes of the Earth atmosphere, particularly of ozone recovery in the stratosphere. Related changes of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation will be determined.

was designed (1) to determine whether evidence of alterations of
long-term growth patterns of several species of eastern forest

support from the National Park Service.

The FORAST project was initiated in 1982 as exploratory research
to document patterns of radial growth of forest trees during the
previous 50 or more years within 15 states in the northeastern
United States. Radial growth measurements from more than 7000
trees are provided along with data on a variety of measured and
calculated indices of stand characteristics (basal area,
density, and competitive indices); climate (temperature,
precipitation, and drought); and anthropogenic pollutants (state
and regional emissions of SO2 and NOx, ozone monitoring data,
and frequency of atmospheric-stagnation episodes and atmospheric
haze). These data were compiled into a single database to
facilitate exploratory analysis of tree growth patterns and
responses to local and regional environmental conditions.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Census of Marine Zooplankton (CMarZ) is a global, taxonomically comprehensive biodiversity assessment of animal plankton, including ~6,800 described species in fifteen phyla.

The Census of Marine Zooplankton (CMarZ) will work toward a taxonomically comprehensive assessment of biodiversity of animal plankton throughout the world oceans (Fig. 1). The project goal is to produce accurate and complete information on zooplankton species diversity, biomass, biogeographical distribution, genetic diversity, and community structure by 2010. Our taxonomic focus is the animals that drift with ocean currents throughout their lives (i.e., the holozooplankton). This assemblage currently includes ~6,800 described species in fifteen phyla; our expectation is that at least that many new species will be discovered as a result of our efforts. The census will encompass unique marine environments and those likely to be inhabited by endemic and undescribed zooplankton species.

Sampling zooplankton in many ocean regions will be accomplished during the first years of the project by coordinating with ongoing, planned, and proposed programs, surveys, and initiatives. CMarZ will also make use of existing data and archived zooplankton collections. The global survey design will be optimized using theoretical and numerical models in collaboration with the CoML FMAP (Future of Marine Animal Populations) project. Sampling systems will include traditional nets and trawls, remote detection, optical sensors, and integrated sensor systems deployed on towed, remotely-operated, or autonomous vehicles and submersibles (Fig. 2). New sampling methodologies are needed to collect and study rare and fragile organisms. Molecular analysis will include determining a DNA barcode (i.e., reference DNA sequence) for each species; describing genetic diversity and structure of populations and species, identifying cryptic species, and reconstructing their evolutionary histories.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">History of Marine Animal Populations</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An interdisciplinary research program using historical and environmental archives to analyze marine population data before and after human impacts on the ocean became significant.

The History of Marine Animal Populations (HMAP), the historical component of the Census of Marine Life (CoML), aims to improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics, specifically with regard to long-term changes in stock abundance, the ecological impact of large-scale harvesting by man, and the role of marine resources in the historical development of human society. Since the earliest historical records, man has harvested a variety of different animals from the oceans. The effects of this activity on marine populations have been of increasing interest over the last century. While ecologists have traditionally aimed to identify the current conditions of many of the animal populations affected both directly and indirectly by harvesting, much less focus has been given to the status of affected populations in earlier times. A historical reference point of marine populations against which modern populations can be compared is necessary in order to determine how ocean ecosystems are changing with respect to human impact and even climate change. HMAP addresses this issue through multidisciplinary studies integrating Marine Ecology, History and Paleo-Ecology. This innnovative combination of research methods and analytical perspectives offers a unique approach to testing theories of the effects of both man’s activities and natural environmental changes on our living marine resources.

Methods and Objectives
To achieve its goals, HMAP relies on the teamwork of ecologists, marine biologists, historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, paleo-ecologists and paleo-oceanographers. These integrated research teams analyze data from a variety of unique sources, such as colonial fisheries and monastic records, modern fisheries statistics, ship logs, tax documents, sediment cores and other environmental records, to piece together changes in specific populations throughout history. The resulting long time-series will improve our understanding of the effects of human activities and environmental factors, such as climate, currents and salinity, on marine ecosystems.

HMAP implements its global mission through a case study approach. The case studies are generally regional in scope and focus on a few species of commercial importance or habitat and biodiversity changes. Individual studies are selected on the basis that the ecosystem has been subject to fishing and that there exists sufficient historical data on catches and harvesting effort. There are currently seven case studies around the world:

    * Northwest Atlantic (Gulf of Maine, Newfoundland-Grand Banks, Greenland cod fisheries)
    * Southwest Pacific (Southeast Australian Shelf and Slope fisheries, New Zealand Shelf fisheries)
    * White and Barents Seas (Russian and Norwegian herring, salmon and cod fisheries, and Atlantic walrus hunting)
    * Norwegian, North and Baltic Seas (Multinational cod, herring and plaice fisheries)
    * Southwest African Shelf (Clupeid fisheries in a continental boundary current system)
    * Worldwide Whaling (Historical whaling in all oceans)
    * Caribbean communities (Impact of the removal of large predators)

Many HMAP projects are interpreting changes in marine populations over the past 500-2000 years, which provides researchers of current and future conditions a baseline that extends back long before the advent of modern technology, or before significant human impact on the ecosystem.

HMAP will result in a better understanding of the role of marine resources in human history and of the factors controlling marine populations. The project will help improve ecological theory, which can be applied to predict the effects of human activities on marine and aquatic ecosystems.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Community Adaptation and Vulnerability in Arctic Regions</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: CAVIAR
Project URL: http://www.arcticcentre.org/caviar
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=157

Problem &amp; Rationale
The Arctic is currently undergoing rapid social and environmental changes, and the cumulative effects are felt across the region. The rapidity and pervasiveness of these changes continue to present challenges to the adaptive capacity for local communities and Arctic societies (ACIA 2005, AHDR 2004). Local responses to these challenges will depend, in part, on the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of human-environment systems, where vulnerability describes the degree to which a system is likely to experience harm due to exposure to a hazard, either a perturbation or a stress, and adaptation refers to change in a system in response to some force or perturbation. Yet, the processes that shape vulnerability and adaptive capacity are not well understood. The aim of this project is to develop and apply methods for assessing the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of human systems in local Arctic communities. This analysis will enable comparison of local communities experiencing (or expected to experience) rapid and cumulative changes under different internal and external conditions. Project results will also indicate areas or actions for improving resilience. 

Research Objectives
The research will enhance empirical and theoretical understanding of processes that shape vulnerability and adaptation across the circumpolar region by
1. further developing the theoretical concept of vulnerability (Turner et al, 2003; Smit and Pilifosova, 2003) and refining and applying an interdisciplinary research methodology for vulnerability studies (ie. Huq and Lim, 2005; Keskitalo, 2004; Ford and Smit, 2004)
2. identifying social and environmental factors and stresses and document the interactions which shape adaptive capacity and vulnerability.
3. improving understanding of the interrelations between local vulnerability and decision-making across scales.

Activities
A framework for vulnerability assessment will be developed to guide field research in communities across the Arctic and to facilitate comparison and integration of results in an interdisciplinary analysis. A methodology for carrying out empirical research will be developed and applied to document the vulnerabilities of communities, including their exposures, their adaptive capacities and their adaptation strategies. The methodology involves collaboration with communities, employs case studies, engages stakeholders, integrates local and indigenous knowledge, is community and place specific, recognizes multiple sources of stimulus, and is fundamentally interdisciplinary. Data will be collected using established protocols and procedures from secondary sources (government records on socio-economic and climate conditions; satellite imagery, reports) and primary sources (interviews, focus groups, participant, questionnaires).
The research will be undertaken in local and indigenous communities in all eight Arctic countries:, Canada, Denmark (Greenland, Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the USA.

Outcomes 
The broad contributions of the project include:
a) Development of a robust vulnerability framework and methodology for community assessment.
b) Knowledge on the nature of the vulnerabilities, exposures and adaptive capacities of Arctic communities, compared and integrated in an analysis for the circumpolar region.
c) Input to policy and decision-making to enhance the resilience and sustainability of Arctic communities.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
      The fourth intercomparison is actually one of the earliest
      conducted by DOE. ICRCCM is a program co-sponsored by DOE, the
      World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the International
      Radiation Commission (IRC). The late Fred Luther gave the best
      description of the rationale for the program: "Since the
      transfer of solar and longwave radiation is the prime physical
      process that drives the circulation of the atmosphere and its
      temperature structure, it is natural that an evaluation of the
      modeling of physical processes important to climate begin with
      radiation." (Luther 1984)

      Principal Findings:

1. Line-by-line models are in good agreement with each other to within
   a few W/m2 (usually within 1%) when arbitrary line width cutoffs
   are universally applied. The ICRCCM concluded that: "Uncertainties
   in the physics of line wings and in the proper treatment of the
   continuum make it impossible for line-by-line models to provide an
   absolute reference . . ." (Luther et al. 1988). Thus, no
   present-day model furnishes a reliable standard by which to judge
   other models, nor are appropriate data available.

2. There is no systematic difference between wide-band and narrow-band
   model results. However, there is a large variation among the band
   models. While average differences from line-by-line results range
   from 5 to 10%, the spread among the band models is several times
   larger.

3. Band model calculations of sensitivities to changes in absorbing
   constituents show poorer agreement with line-by-line results, and a
   much larger spread, than calculations of flux components. For
   example, when is doubled, the median band model sensitivities
   differ by up to 18% from line-by-line values, while their spread is
   an order of magnitude larger.

4. In cases of only and only, the spread in results among band models
   increases considerably compared to the case when all absorbing
   gases are included; this indicates that the success in the latter
   case is partly fortuitous because of the way absorbing bands
   overlap in the Earth's atmosphere.

5. For the longwave clear cases, with about 40 participants
   representing almost all the world's major modeling groups, ICRCCM
   revealed intermodel disagreements in fluxes and flux sensitivity to
   constituent changes ranging from 30 to 70% (Luther et
   al. 1988). The disagreements are worst for single absorbing gas
   atmospheres, indicating that the better agreement found in the
   all-gas cases is partly accidental. Subsequent ICRCCM calculations,
   involving cloudy longwave cases, and clear and cloudy shortwave
   cases, have revealed equally large or larger disagreements, ranging
   up to 20 to 30% in fluxes and up to 70% in flux sensitivity to
   constituent changes.

6. Comparisons are still in progress for vertical profiles of
   radiative heating rates. Disagreements in radiative heating rates
   are expected to be larger than for fluxes, because heating rate is
   the derivative of flux and taking derivatives magnifies errors

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
Beginning in May 1995, the NASA ER-2 has flown with instruments
to investigate the movement of long-lived trace gases in the
lower stratosphere and upper troposphere. By increasing our
understanding of such motions, the Stratospheric Tracers of
Atmospheric Transport (STRAT) experiment should increase our
ability to determine whether certain gases in aircraft exhaust
get into the prime ozone production region in the tropics.

The STRAT flights are out of NASA Ames Research Center and
Barbers Point Naval Air Station. STRAT deployments have been
successfully staged in May 1995, October-November 1995,
January-February 1996, July-August 1996, and September 1996. The
final regular deployment of STRAT is scheduled to take place in
December 1996.

Objectives:

1. To define the rate of transport of trace gases (such as HSCT
exhaust emissions) from the stratosphere to the troposphere,
i.e., to determine the global burden that will result from
continuous aircraft emissions into the stratosphere. This
objective requires detailed measurements of tracer
concentrations close to the tropopause, where tracer gradients
are very steep.

2. To improve understanding of dynamical coupling and rates for
transport of trace gases between tropical regions (where ozone
formation is most rapid) and higher latitudes and lower
altitudes (where most ozone resides). For example, we seek to
define the quantity of exhaust entrained from mid-latitude
source regions into the tropical upwelling zone, where it can be
transported to critical altitudes (above 25 mbar) in the
tropics.

3. To improve understanding of the chemistry in the upper
troposphere and lower stratosphere. This will include the first
concerted measurements of the coupled chemistry of odd hydrogen,
odd nitrogen, and CO in the near-tropopause
region. Understanding the partitioning of NOy in this region is
poorly constrained and the lack of OH and HO2 measurements has
hindered progress. These observations will address some of the
key issues related to the influence of both a potential HSCT
fleet as well as the existing subsonic fleet on ozone.

4. To provide data sets for testing two-dimensional (2-D) and
three-dimensional (3-D) models used in assessments of impacts
from stratospheric aviation, including meteorological data for
application to data-assimilation models and
globally-representative ensembles of tracer data.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The "Wind Events and Shelf Transport" (WEST) program was an interdisciplinary study of coastal upwelling off northern California in 2000-03. WEST was comprised of modeling and field observations. The primary goal of WEST was to better describe and understand the competing influences of wind forcing on planktonic productivity in coastal waters. While increased upwelling-favorable winds lead to increased nutrient supply, they also result in reduced light exposure due to deeper surface mixed layers and increased advective loss of plankton from coastal waters. The key to understanding high levels of productivity, amidst these competing responses to wind forcing, is the temporal and spatial structure of upwelling. Temporal fluctuations and spatial patterns allow strong upwelling that favors nutrient delivery to be juxtaposed with less energetic conditions that favor stratification and plankton blooms.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The SOLVE II Mission is an international field campaign designed to
acquire correlative data needed to validate the
Meteor-3M/Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III
satellite mission. The field campaign will also acquire correlative
measurements with atmospheric chemistry instruments onboard the
ADEOS-II and ENVISAT satellite missions to enhance ozone comparison
and loss studies utilizing these data sets.  Measurements will be
made during the Arctic winter using the NASA DC-8 aircraft, balloon
platforms, and ground-based instruments.  These activities will take
place in close collaboration with the European Validation of
International Satellites and Study of Ozone Loss (VINTERSOL) campaign,
which will include flights of the DLR Falcon and Russian Geophysica
M55 aircraft, other balloon platforms and ground-based instruments.

SOLVE-II is co-sponsored by NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Program
(UARP), Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project (AEAP), Atmospheric
Chemistry Modeling and Analysis Program (ACMAP), and Earth Observing
System (EOS) of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE).  VINTERSOL is
sponsored by the European Commission.

Dr. Michael Kurylo and Dr. Phil DeCola are the SOLVE II Program
Scientists.  Dr. Mark Schoeberl and Dr. Paul Newman are the SOLVE II
DC-8 Project Scientists, and Mr. Michael Craig is the SOVLE II Project
Manager.

SOLVE II has five basic science objectives.
These objectives are:

1.
Measurement of the polar ozone loss rate in early to mid-winter.
Relative contributions to low ozone levels from interannual variations
in ozone transport and photochemistry will be quantified.

2.
The understanding of polar stratospheric clouds (PSC's). The
composition of PSC's and the role they play in the interactions
between chlorine and nitrogen reservoir species will be examined.

3.
The study of photochemical processes. The seasonal evolution of
chemical processes, in particular the activation and deactivation of
chlorine, and their impact on ozone loss will be observed.

4.
The measurement of polar air transport and dynamics.  The initial
state of polar stratospheric air will be defined and the exchange of
this air between the polar vortex and the mid-latitudes will be
observed. This will allow a better understanding of the effect of
transport on the evolution of the ozone.  It will also lead to better
predictions of the sensitivity of polar air to jet engine exhaust from
current and future aircraft.

5.
SAGE III instrument validation. Ozone, aerosol, water vapor, and NO2
measurements from the DC-8 will be compared to SAGE III instrument
measurements to prove the accuracy of satellite observations.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The characterization of Antarctic sea ice thickness on a circumpolar quantitative basis will provide, for the first time, a fully quantitative baseline data set for monitoring of future change in the Antarctic sea ice cover. Using the coupling between thickness, physical property and remote sensing measurements, a full validation of altimetry (for ice thickness), and passive and active radar (for thin and thick ice characterization) will enable future monitoring to rely more on remote sensing than costly and regionally limited field surveys. Ice thickness is the principal quantitative measure of ocean-atmosphere exchanges and the data sets will therefore be the gold standard for validation of air-ice-ocean coupled models, and thereby increase confidence in their capability for future prediction. Sea ice mass balance determines salt and freshwater fluxes to the ocean, and therefore contributes directly to the formation of water masses and oceanic circulation characteristics in polar regions. Understanding the coupling between ice physics, biology and biogeochemistry will determine the direction and magnitude of gas fluxes and sediment contributions from sea ice derived fluxes. The role of ice-covered oceans in present day and past exchanges (as determined from continental ice core measurements) and relation to climate change will be better correlated and quantifie

                The Global Oscillation Network Group
The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project was proposed in 1984 by
the National Solar Observatory as a community activity.  Funding for the
project from the National Science Foundation started in 1986.  The project is
intended to provide 3 years of nearly uninterrupted helioseismograms to allow
detailed study of the stratification and dynamics of the solar interior.
The project is in the process of developing a network of observational sites
and an instrument based on the principle of Fourier tachometry to do the
observing.  In addition the GONG datacenter will store the network data and
do the standard data reduction.  Science teams have been organized and are
actively engaged in providing technical support for various aspects of the
project and are preparing for the analysis and interpretation of the data
products.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is an international effort to
coordinate and foster long-term, routine, globally-relevant,
scientifically-based and systematic ocean observations and
applications.
GOOS is built upon research, and provides data for research, but is
not itself a research program.  Rather, it is focussed on making use
of research, of applying knowledge for the public good, and of
motivating basic and applied research in topical areas.
Guided by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International Council of
Scientific Unions (ICSU), and the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP), the planning for GOOS is taking place within five specific
areas:
        Climate Monitoring, Assessment, and Prediction
        Monitoring and Assessment of Living Marine Resources
        Monitoring of the Coastal Zone Environment and its Changes
        Assessment and Prediction of the Health of the Ocean
        Marine Meteorological and Operational Oceanographic Services
U.S. GOOS activities are contained within many U.S. agencies, including
NOAA, NSF, NASA, Navy (Office of Oceanographer and ONR), DOE, DOI,
EPA, and State.  A U.S. GOOS Interagency Working Group coordinates
these activities.
The climate module is the leading candidate for implementation
by U.S. GOOS because it is the most well-developed in terms of
strategy, applications, and technology.  The highest priority
within the climate module is the continuation of the TOGA Observing
System beyond its research phase (1984-1994) and into an operational
status for long-term provision of the data needed for forecasting of
El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.  Economic studies have
shown that the investment to obtain such observations and make such
predictions is returned many times over in benefits to the
agricultural sector in the U.S., plus additional benefits to other
sectors.  At a lower priority within the climate module are the
long-term observations needed for the detection of climate change.
The second U.S. GOOS urgency is the development of an interagency
Coastal GOOS Program, including those aspects of all the GOOS modules
that are relevant near the coast.  The coastal zone is under
increasing stress through population growth and land-use policies, yet
is also the region of major sea-borne commerce and living marine
resources.  Balancing resources against development requires a strong
information base and predictive capability; GOOS is dedicated to
making this happen in a timely, affordable, and customer-oriented
manner.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Paleobiology Database is a public resource for the scientific community. It has been organized and operated by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, international group of paleobiological researchers. Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic data for marine and terrestrial animals and plants of any geological age, as well ... as web-based software for statistical analysis of the data. The project&amp;#039;s wider, long-term goal is to encourage collaborative efforts to answer large-scale paleobiological questions by developing a useful database infrastructure and bringing together large data sets. 

The Database currently includes six main tables: references, taxonomic names, 
taxonomic opinions, primary collection data, taxonomic occurrences, and 
reidentifications of occurrences. The tables are tied together relationally 
with record ID numbers. Most tables are relatively simple; the collection table has many fields that are described on a separate database structure page. We are working to add tables that will handle taxonomic authority information and taxonomic opinions (e.g., synonymies). At a later date we will add tables to handle phylogenetic relationships, ecomorphological attributes, stratigraphic sections, radioisotopic age estimates, and other data. 

Some of the major datasets within the Paleobiology Database includes: 
-North American Mammalian Paleofaunal Database 2002 
-Middle Devonian fossils of the Michigan Basin 
-Taxonomy and distribution of Late Jurassic - Eocene lissamphibians 
-Jurassic marine faunas of France, Greenland, Portugal, and the United Kingdom 
-Silurian and Early Devonian plants 2001 
-Ivany Thesis Collection: Middle Eocene US Gulf Coast Macrofossils 
-Maastrichtian bivalve faunas of the world 1994 
-Marine Bivalve Genera, Revision of Sepkoski&amp;#039;s Compendium

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Open Geospatial Consortium/Web Map Service is a specification developed
by the Open Geospatial Consortium that defines three WMS operations:

1. GetCapabilities returns service-level metadata, which is a
description of the service's information content and acceptable
request parameters;

2. GetMap returns a map image whose geospatial and dimensional
parameters are well defined;

3. GetFeatureInfo (optional) returns information about
particular features shown on a map.

This specification defines a syntax for World Wide Web (WWW) Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs) that invoke each of these operations. Also, an Extensible
Markup Language (XML) encoding is defined for service-level metadata.

When requesting a map, a client may specify the information to be shown on the
map (one or more "Layers"), possibly the "Styles" of those Layers, what portion
of the Earth is to be mapped (a "Bounding Box"), the projected or geographic
coordinate reference system to be used (the "Spatial Reference System," or
SRS), the desired output format, the output size (Width and Height), and
background transparency and color.  When two or more maps are produced with the
same Bounding Box, Spatial Reference System, and output size, the results can
be accurately layered to produce a composite map. The use of image formats that
support transparent backgrounds allows the lower Layers to be visible.
Furthermore, individual map Layers can be requested from different Servers. The
WMS specification thus enables the creation of a network of distributed Map
Servers from which Clients can build customized maps.

A particular WMS provider in a distributed WMS network need only be the steward
of its own data collection. This stands in contrast to vertically integrated
web mapping sites that gather in one place all of the data to be made
accessible by their own private interface.

Atlantis will carry the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and
Science-1 (ATLAS-1), 12 instruments from the United States, France,
Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Japan, that will
conduct 13 experiments to study the chemistry of the atmosphere, solar
radiation, space plasma physics and ultraviolet astronomy.  ATLAS-1 is
planned to be the first of several ATLAS flights designed to cover an
entire 11-year solar cycle, the regular period of energetic activity
by the sun.  Co- manifested with ATLAS-1 is the Shuttle Solar
Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV), which provides highly
calibrated measurements of ozone to fine-tune measurements made by
other NASA and NOAA satellites.

     Commanding Atlantis will be Charles Bolden, making his third
space flight.  Brian Duffy will serve as pilot, making his first
shuttle flight.  Mission Specialists include Kathy Sullivan, making
her third flight; Dave Leestma, making his third space flight; and
Mike Foale, making his first space flight.  Payload specialists will
be Byron Lichtenberg, making his second flight, and Dirk Frimout,
Belgian Scientist, making his first flight.

     ATLAS operations will continue 24 hours a day, with the crew
split into two teams each on a 12-hour shift.  The Red Team will
consist of Leestma, Foale and Lichtenberg.  The Blue Team will be
Duffy, Sullivan and Frimout.  Bolden, as Commander, will set his own
hours.

     Secondary experiments aboard Atlantis will include Space Tissue
Loss, a study of the effects of weightlessness on body tissues; the
Visual Function Tester, a study of the effects of weightlessness on
human vision; the Radiation Monitoring Equipment, an often-flown
device that measures radiation aboard the Shuttle; Investigations into
Polymer Membrane Processing, a study of developing polymer membranes
used as filters in many industries and in space and the Cloud Logic to
Optimize Use of Defense Systems, an investigation to quantify the
variation in apparent cloud cover as a function of the angle at which
clouds of various types are viewed.

     Also flying on STS-45 will be NASA's Get Away Special payload, a
program which provides individuals and organizations the opportunity
to send scientific research and development experiments on board a
Space Shuttle.

     In addition, the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment will provide
amateur radio operators worldwide, plus students at several selected
schools, the opportunity to converse with crew members aboard
Atlantis.

CMIP, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, is the analog of AMIP
for global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. CMIP
began in 1995 under the auspices of the Numerical Experimentation
Group 2 (NEG-2) of CLIVAR. The PCMDI supports CMIP in much the same
way that it supports AMIP: by helping NEG-2 to determine the scope of
the project, by maintaining the project's data base, and by
participating in data analysis. CMIP has received model output from
pre-industrial climate simulations ("control runs") of 18 coupled
GCMs. A new phase of CMIP (CMIP2) will examine model responses to
anthropogenic climate forcing.
The second phase of the project (CMIP2) began in January 1997. This
phase will examine model responses to an idealized scenario of
anthropogenic climate forcing: a 1% per year increase in atmospheric
carbon dioxide. Diagnosis of the model output will produce the first
comprehensive data base on model predictions of future climatic
changes.
More CMIP information is available on the World Wide Web.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A scatterometer is an instrument that measures near-surface ocean winds by sending a constant stream of radar pulses toward Earth from an orbiting satellite. When the radar pulse reflects back off the ocean surface, some of its energy is scattered by small, wind-driven waves rippling across the sea. By measuring these changes in the reflected radar signals, engineers can deduce the speed and direction of the winds that caused the ocean waves. 

The NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) instrument was designed and built by JPL and flown on Japan's Midori satellite (previously known as the Advanced Earth Observation Satellite (ADEOS), the largest satellite ever developed by that country. Following launch from Japan's Tanegashima Space Center on August 17, 1996 (the evening of August 16 in U.S. Pacific Daylight Time or Eastern Daylight Time), the satellite circled Earth in an orbit that took it close to the planet's north and south poles. NSCAT yielded 268,000 measurements of ocean winds each day, covering more than 90 percent of Earth's ice-free seas.

to interannual time scales.
JGOFS is divided into several task teams including: global survey, process
study, deep ocean flux, continental margins, photosynthesis measurements,
remote sensing, time series, synthesis and modelling, and data management.
A global carbon dioxide (CO2) air-sea flux survey is being carried out in
close collaboration with the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  Process studies are regional and
occur in the North Atlantic, Equatorial Pacific, North Pacific, the
Arabian Sea, and the Southern Ocean. Time series studies include the
Bermuda-Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS); the Hawaii Ocean Time-series
(HOTS); European Station for Time-Series in the Ocean, Canary Islands

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Building a cyberinfrastructure to index and organize what is known about microbes, the world's smallest organisms, which account for 90 percent of biomass in oceans.

The oceans worldwide are teeming with microbial life forms invisible to the naked eye. An estimated 3.6 x 1030 microbial cells of untold diversity account for &gt; 90% of the total oceanic biomass. The number of viral particles may be one hundred fold greater. Rich, chemosynthetic microbial communities thrive at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Abundant archaea, one of the two prokaryotic domains of life, populate oceanic midwaters. Very large populations of phytoplankton including diatoms, dinoflagellates, picoflagellates and cyanobacteria, the primary catalysts in carbon fixation, orchestrate the cycling of nitrogen and form the base of the traditional marine food web. The heterotrophic bacteria belonging to the SAR11 group dominate communities of ocean-surface bacterioplankton while nonphotosynthetic protists (usually single-cell eukaryotes) of unknown diversity control the size of picoplankton (plankton less than 2 µm) populations and regulate the supply of nutrients into the ocean's food webs. Microbes account for the preponderance of life's genetic and metabolic variation, but our understanding of microbial diversity and the evolution of its population structures in the oceans is only fragmentary.

The International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM) will facilitate the inventory of this microbial diversity developing a strategy to (1) catalogue all known diversity of single-cell organisms inclusive of the Bacteria, Archaea, Protista and associated viruses, (2) to explore and discover unknown microbial diversity, and (3) to place that knowledge into appropriate ecological and evolutionary contexts.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In an effort to better understand the potential global impacts of climate
change on agriculture, in 1990 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
contracted the Goddard Institute for Space Studies to coordinate a major study
of the effects of changing temperature and precipitation regimes and increased
CO2  concentrations on crop production and its economic implications. The
central aim of the study was to provide an assessment of potential climate
change impacts on world crop production, including quantitative estimates of
yield changes of major food, cash and industrial crops, prices, trade and risk
of hunger. Agricultural scientists from 18 countries estimated potential
changes in crop growth and production at 125 key agricultural sites using
compatible crop models and consistent climate change scenarios. The study
assessed the implications of climate change for world crop yields taking into
account uncertainty in the level of climate change expected, physiological
effects of CO2 on plant growth, and different adaptive responses. Projected
yields at the agricultural sites were then aggregated to major trading regions,
and fed into a global trade model (the Basic Linked System or BLS) in order to
produce regional estimates of potential price increases, food shortages, and
risk of hunger.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">From April 2002 through June 2004, the Regional Ecology and Coastal Hydrography
(REACH, "http://www.reach.unh.edu/") project conducted monthly field sampling
in the western Gulf of Maine. REACH is one of five seed projects associated
with the UNH center of excellence for Coastal Ocean Observing and Analysis
(COOA). COOA is developing and implementing new methodologies and approaches
for coastal ocean observing across the spectrum from data acquisition,
analysis, integration and synthesis.

The objective of REACH is to document and understand the functional
inter-relationships among the major elements of the planktonic assemblage in
the waters of western Gulf of Maine. The field program characterized the
physical dynamics, nutrient availability, and phytoplankton and zooplankton
assemblages. A long-term goal of this effort is to work toward a predictive
index of harmful algal bloom (HAB) occurrences in near-shore waters of the
western Gulf of Maine based on an integrated assessment of the planktonic
community. The comprehensive nature of the study also enables this work to
serve as a baseline for the western Gulf of Maine, against which future studies
can be compared.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=27

The aim of this project is to study to what degree was research in the Arctic and Antarctic during the polar years primarily driven by scientific criteria. To what extent were compromises made in the light of political barriers and logistical limitations? Another aspect is the role of new technologies, which is highlightened by the start of the first satellites and which has a significant input both in polar transport and research. Employing historical perspectives we will review essential background factors at work in the three distinct periods (both scientific and non-scientific), when nations chose to participate in the IPYs. In addition, we will consider the substantial factors that led certain major nations to choose not to contribute to the Polar Years (Great Britain 1882/83, Germany 1932/33, 1957/58, etc). Traditionally, field science practiced in remote geographical regions was either a by-product of exploration or an activity exploited by territorial claimants. The early attempts to establish an international polar organization will be seen as a backdrop to the later success in creating the Scientific Committee on Arctic Research (SCAR). Pertinent in this respect are the different roles played by non-governmental organizations as distinct from intergovernmental organizations or modes of international organization. Factors that enabled (or contrained or hindered) the institutionalisation of polar research more broadly under the auspices of the polar years will be studied also with an eye to drawing lessons for the future. The political role of the Antarctic treaty and the role of science in it is of course an important question in this context, as Antarctica at the political level became constructed as a continent by and for science (and peace). It is important to include the use of oral history, while some IGY veterans and constructors of the Antarctic treaty are still living.Such a study would not be complete without examining the impact of the Cold War on the IGY. Recent historical work has indicated that the IGY was simultaneously a crucial instance of international scientific co-operation at the height of political tensions between the Eastern and Western Blocs, but also an activity tightly integrated into the national security aims of major participant-states, including the United States and the Soviet Union. How Cold War tensions affected the practice of science during the IGY, and what lessons contemporary science planners and policy-makers can gain from a better understanding of the IGY's achievements and disappointments, are important anticipated outcomes from this project.

DATA PROCESSING

Processing at the University of Rhode Island

 Initial data processing and float tracking were done at URI
under the supervision of H. T. Rossby. This consisted of subdividing the ALS
records into individual float files. The signals for an individual float were
extracted from the ALS data, and the floats were tracked in two steps. First,
the three ALSs which best surrounded a float geographically were used to track
it hyperbolically, giving a series of positions and the time that the float
emitted the tracking signal. These signaling times were used to obtain an
initial offset and drift rate for the float's clock. Then, the best pair of
receivers were used to track the float with circular (range-range) navigation
using the clock corrections and speed of sound corrections.

 The tracking procedure during GUSREX was identical to that used for
previous SOFAR float experiments and described by Spain, O'Gara, and Rossby
(1980). The three daily times of arrival (TOA) of each SOFAR float's acoustic
signal were low-pass filtered and smoothed using a least squares polynomial fit
averaged over 11 observations (3 2/3 days) which corresponds to a half power of
1.5 days. Float positions were obtained from the smoothed TOAs using range-
range tracking. The final float trajectories were then smoothed with a filter
similar to that used on the TOA's. A "master position" tape containing indi-
vidual float trajectories smoothed to 3 positions per day was prepared and sent
to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and this was used for our sub-
sequent processing and data reduction.  For each position, a smoothed velocity
and 48 hour average of temperature and pressure are included. Temperature and
pressure, telemetered from the float on alternate days (Spain et al., 1980)
appear with the positions for those days. These data have been presented in two
informal reports prepared by the URI SOFAR Float Group (Line Experiment FLoats
1980-1981, Line Experiment FLoats 1980-1982, Preliminary Data Report).

Processing at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution

  In order to use the float data to make reasonable calculations of
eddy kinetic energy, variances, &amp; vertical velocities, the data were careful-
ly reviewed for correctness. Tests on various methods of smoothing, subsamp-
ling, and filtering the data were performed to determine how the data set
would be processed. Analysis of the results indicated that the best basic data
set would include one position for each day, since the smoothing already done
on the tracks had eliminated frequencies higher than a day (inertial and tidal).
The velocity components would be derived from the daily fixes using a cubic
spline curve fit. This method produced velocities that are different from the
URI velocities which are smoothed independently of the positions. The 48 hour
average temperature and pressure, transmitted by the float on alternate days
were selected rather than the smoothed temperature and pressure provided with
the URI format.

  Basic processing was accomplished using a series of routines written
by Roger Goldsmith and Terry McKee, known as the FLOATER programs. The initial
program, REFORM, reads and reformats the data into VAX ASCII files, one for
each float, in FLOATER format. In this form, the data is easy to access, man-
ipulate, edit and back up. The raw files were then passed through a sub-sampler,
SSFDIF, that subsampled the first of the original 3 daily positions and recal-
culated the east and north components of velocity based on a 24 hour interval.
First differences between consecutive temperature and pressure values were
calculated. Listings of these derived values were produced along with prelim-
inary trajectory and time series plots. These were reviewed to identify and
eliminate erroneous data. Unreasonably high speeds were used to identify bad
positions. Radical changes in temperature that were not accompanied by a similar
change in pressure (or vice versa) usually indicated a bad value. Temperature
and pressure values that drifted outside the range of the sensors were also
defined as bad. These points were removed by an editing program, FLEDIT, and
flagged as gaps in the data. Gaps of less than ten days duration in position,
temperature and pressure were then linearly interpolated. Daily values of
temperature and pressure were interpolated from the bi-daily values recorded.
Files with gaps of greater than ten days in position information were broken
into sub files (GU109, GU154). These series were plotted and reviewed once
again for incongruities. Program FFSPLINE then fit a cubic spline to the float
positions and recomputed the east and north components of velocity based on the
bias and slope of consecutive positions.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">During the summers of 1983 and 1984, NASA conducted an intensive experiment in a portion of the Superior National Forest (SNF) near Ely, Minnesota, U.S.A. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the ability of remote sensing to provide estimates of biophysical properties of ecosystems, such as leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and net primary productivity (NPP).

The study area covered a 50 X 50 km area centered at approximately 48 degrees North latitude and 92 degrees West longitude in northeastern Minnesota at the southern edge of the North American boreal forest. The SNF is mostly covered by boreal forest. Boreal forests were chosen for this project because of their relative taxonomic simplicity, their great extent, and their potential sensitivity to climatic change.

Detailed vegetation data were collected on the ground for about 100 sampled sites. These sites represent a range of stand density and age for spruce and aspen and also include jackpine and mixed stands. At each site, five circular subplots of 16 meters in diameter were sampled within a large plot of 60 meters in diameter. Within the subplots, all woody stems over 2 meters in height were tallied by species, diameter, and height.

Satellite, aircraft, helicopter, and ground observations were obtained for the study area. Climate data for the period 1972-1990 were also complied. These data constitute a unique data set for the investigation of the relationships between the radiometric and biophysical properties of vegetated canopies. This is perhaps the most complete data set of its type ever collected over a forested region.

Within each subplot, coverage by vegetation was determined for the canopy, subcanopy, and understory. Thirty each of black spruce and aspen trees from outside the plots were sacrificed and dimension analysis relations developed between diameter at breast height, biomass, and leaf area index. Also, above-ground NPP was estimated for each test site. For the aspen sites, bark area and understory leaf area indexes were found. During the spring, measurements of understory leaf extension and canopy coverage were made on several days to describe the phenology of an aspen stand. Measurements of the optical properties of canopy components were made for wavelengths between 0.35 and 2.1 micrometers. Reflectance and transmittance properties of leaves and needles of eight major overstory tree species and three understory shrubs were measured. Multiple measurements of aspen and spruce allow an investigation of the variability of optical properties within a species, spagnum moss and leaf litter.

Above-canopy reflectance was observed by a helicopter-mounted Barnes Modular Multiband Radiometer (MMR). The helicopter MMR data have a spatial resolution of approximately 32 meters. In 1983, 10 days of data were collected between May and October, with a total of 105 sites observed. In 1984, 8 days of data were collected between May and September, with a total of 29 sites observed. Several sites have multiple observations, to allow studies of seasonal variation.

Thematic Mapper Simulator (TMS) data were collected from the NASA C-130 flying over the SNF. The flights were in a "criss-cross" pattern to allow observation of the same location with multiple sun and view angles. The TMS scans out to 50 degrees off nadir; in flights at 5000 feet above ground level, a nadir pixel covers 3.81 meters along the scan. Three days of TMS data are presented; these data have been atmospherically corrected and calibrated to determine surface reflectance. A key goal of the experiment was to use the aircraft measurements to scale up to satellite observations for the remote sensing of biophysical parameters.

This project is a multinational campaign to collect a range of data that will impact on our understanding of the Earth as a bipolar coupled system, where Antarctica's evolution impacts on global scale changes of sea level, ice volume and climate. This project involves a transect from the centre of the Antarctic continent, where the ice sheet is underlain by the Gamburtsev Mountains, northwards into Prydz Bay. We will acquire major new data sets including offshore marine data, gravity, magnetics, ice radar soundings and a wealth of geological observations. This will also be part of a multinational Gamburtsev Mountains IPY expedition that will include the GAMBIT (EoI 558) regional aerogeophysical program, a Chinese drilling program (GMDP) and a passive seismic experiment (GAMSEIS - EoI 412).

The main objective is to derive a four dimensional evolutionary history of the area of East Antarctica affected by the world's largest glacier (Lambert) and associated ice shelf (Amery). The project is focused in an area that exhibits the largest set of geological exposures in East Antarctica (Prince Charles Mountains). This southern part of the transect will cover the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains. Nothing is known about the nature of this ice-covered Antarctic "highland". It was from this region that the expanding Antarctic ice sheet originated and it has been suggested that during warmer periods, this terrain was drained first by ice streams and then, nearer the coast, by rivers from which thick sediments accumulated. In the Late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic these sediments probably included the Amery Group of East Antarctica together with a huge succession of similarly aged sediments that were deposited in Africa, India and Australia. The modern East Antarctic ice sheet is also thought to have nucleated on this highland, and progressively expanded from there to cover the continent as Antarctica gradually cooled.

The marine sub-project will target the Lambert Rift system in the area of Prydz Bay with acquisition of deep crustal geophysical data and sediment cores that will be integrated with the continental based data sets. The sedimentary and glacial history of Prydz Bay and the structural grain of its uppermost basement are relatively well known from extensive shallow to medium depth seismic reflection profiling and ODP Legs 119 and 188. This existing information will serve as an important parameter basis to build deep dynamic crustal and lithospheric models of the evolution of the Lambert Rift system and its role in the ice-sheet dynamics of East Antarctica.

The marine geoscience activities will be facilitated through the deployment of the RV "Polarstern" and the RV "Akademik Alexander Karpinsky" in 2007, with a continental and airborne based program in the Prince Charles Mountains and the Gamburtsev Mountains during the 2007/08 austral summer.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In the GHOST project, we intend to explore the climate evolution of the entire Holocene. Our perspective consists of two baselines: the worldwide distribution of existing, reedited, and new collected marine Alkenone temperature data; and actual but low resolution general circulation models with high computational efficiency, de- signed for long term paleoclimate studies. In order to increase spatial coverage of Holocene time series we will concentrate on marine sediments with relatively low but highest achievable resolution in the range of 50 to 200 years. Both, the data reconstruc- tion and the modelling efforts within this project, aim to investigate three-dimensional spatial-temporal patterns, i.e. two dimensions (the Earth&amp;#039;s surface) and the time as third dimension. The advanced analysis of spatial and temporal variability in the data and in the model should enable the comprehension of climate changes detected in the data and the verification of climate variability observed in the model. Pattern analysis will provide a better understanding of the heterogenity in Holocene warming or cool- ing and the related mechanisms. The extension of the Holocene climate simulation into the next few centuries will enable a better assessment of future climatic change, due to similarities or dissimilarities between patterns of natural and anthropogenic disturbed climates.

The fundamental objective of the BMD program is to develop the
capability to defend the forces and territories of the United States,
its Allies, and friends against all classes of ballistic missile
threats. The Department will develop technologies and deploy systems
promising an effective, reliable, and affordable missile defense
system. The RDT&amp;E program is designed to develop effective systems
over time by developing layered defenses that employ complementary
sensors and weapons to engage threat targets in the boost, midcourse,
and terminal phases of flight and to deploy that capability
incrementally.

At the direction of the Secretary of Defense, we have developed a
research, development and test program that focuses on missile defense
as a single integrated BMD system, no longer differentiating between
theater and national missile defense. This revised structure involves
three basic thrusts. First, the new BMD program will build on the
technical progress we have made to date by providing the funding
required to develop and test selective elements of the current program
fully.

Second, the new program will pursue a broad range of activities in
order to aggressively evaluate and develop technologies for the
integration of land, sea, air, or space-based platforms to counter
ballistic missiles in all phases of their flight. The new program will
not cut corners. Rather, it is designed to pursue parallel development
paths to improve the likelihood of achieving an effective, layered
missile defense.

Third, the new testing program will incorporate a larger number of
tests than in the past. They will employ more realistic scenarios and
countermeasures. This will allow us to achieve greater confidence in
our planning and development. Through this robust testing activity, we
may discover opportunities to accelerate elements of the program based
on their performance, and increase the overall credibility and
capability of BMD systems. This approach is designed to enable
contingency use of the demonstrated BMD capabilities, if directed.

The goal of the BMD System is a layered defense that provides multiple
engagement opportunities along the entire flight path of a ballistic
missile. Over the next three to five years we will pursue parallel
technical paths to reduce schedule and cost risk in the individual
RDT&amp;E efforts. We will explore and demonstrate kinetic and directed
energy kill mechanisms for potential sea-, ground-, air-, and
space-based operations to engage threat missiles in the boost,
midcourse, and terminal phases of flight. In parallel, sensor suites
and battle management and command and control (BMC2) will be developed
to form the backbone of the BMD System.

    -Investigating the physical mechanisms underlying climate fluctuations and
     to develop and test appropriate climate models.
Project Description:
GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Program) was organized by the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the International Council of
Scientific Unions (ICSU) to study the dynamics of atmospheric behavior
with the goal of improving the accuracy of weather forecasting.  The
First GARP Global Experiment (FGGE) which is also known as the Global
Weather Experiment (GWE) was carried out under this joint program.
The experiment began 1 December 1978 and ended 30 November 1979.  This
venture involved over 140 countries and was the largest international
atmospheric experiment of its time.  The FGGE also encompassed the
summer and winter Asian Monsoon Experiments (MONEX) and the West
African Monsoon Experiment (WAMEX) designed to study monsoonal
circulations.  The FGGE was designed to observe and measure the
development of global weather systems and to accumulate an enormous
data set for investigating the physics and dynamics of the global
atmospheric circulation and for understanding the mechanisms governing
changes in weather and climate.
Data Sources:
The FGGE observing system consisted of the World Weather Watch (WWW)
surface/upper-air network and voluntary observing ships, commercial
aircraft, polar orbiting and geostationary satellites, drifting
meteorological buoys mainly in the southern hemispheric oceans.
During special observing periods (SOP) 5 January - 5 March 1979 and 1
May - June 30 1979, additional observing systems comprised of tropical
wind observing ships, meteorological reconnaissance aircraft and
stratospheric constant-level balloons were deployed.  The WWW
observing system consisted of 1030 upper-air stations, 2390 surface
stations and surface synoptic reports from Mobile Ship Stations.
Flight level data were supplied by 80 commercial aircraft equipped
with the Aircraft Integrated Data System (AIDS) providing temperature
and wind measurements, along with 17 commercial aircraft equipped with
the Aircraft to Satellite Data Relay (ASDAR) system providing
identical data.  The three polar orbiting satellites, NOAA-5, TIROS-N
and NOAA-6 contributed temperature and humidity profiles, sea surface
temperature (SST) data, high resolution pictures of clouds, surface
wind speed over the oceans, total atmospheric water vapor and
stratospheric soundings (NIMBUS-7).  TIROS-N and NOAA-6 also supported
the ARGOS data collection and platform location system associated with
the Southern Hemisphere Buoy System and the Tropical Constant Level
Balloon System.  The five geostationary satellites, METEOSAT,
GOES-Indian Ocean, GMS, GOES-WEST and GOES-EAST provided upper-air
wind vectors from cloud motions, SST and communication support for
ASDAR.  The Southern Hemisphere Drifting Buoy System consisted of 301
buoys transmitting SST and pressure data to the TIROS-N/ARGOS system
with additional buoys distributed by aircraft as gaps developed.  The
Tropical Wind Observing Ships (TWOS) totaling 40 in SOP I and 43 in
SOP II were equipped with upper-air sounding systems and wind-finding
radar.  The Aircraft Dropwindsonde System (ACDWS) consisted of a fleet
of long-range aircraft flying daily during the two SOP's along six
tracks in the equatorial tropics, three in the Pacific, one in the
Atlantic and two in the Indian Ocean.  Flight level data was obtained
while 5091 sondes yielded temperature, pressure and humidity
observations from below the flight altitude (200-400mb) to the
surface.  The Tropical Constant Level Balloon System (TCLBS) utilized
313 balloon launches at the 140mb level (above ACDWS) from Canton
Island and Guam in the Pacific, and Ascension Island in the Atlantic
to provide wind observations.
Data Products:
The GARP/FGGE data are identified as Level-I, II and III corresponding
to raw data (primary data), observations (meteorological parameters)
and analyzed data (initial parameters).  The Level-II and III data are
subdivided into 'a' (data collected operationally in near-real time,
'b' (data collected in both real and delayed time to obtain the most
complete data set) and 'c' (data collected for climate research).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: SLiCA - RAAS
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=386

At the recommendation of the Joint Committee, the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic Remote Access Analysis System is now linked to the IPY proposal, Present day processes, Past changes, and Spatiotemporal variability of biotic, abiotic and socio-environmental conditions and resource components along and across the Arctic delimitation zone. The SLICA-RAAS component will focus on spatiotemporal variability of socio-environmental conditions. SLICA-RAAS will contribute to the objectives of assessing the socio-economic impacts of potential future changes in the transitional zones, incorporating results into an expert information system, which will be utilized for estimating climate change responses, sustainable ecosystem management and landscape planning in support of policy decisions; To exchange methods on climate change monitoring, sustainable land use strategy and science/policy issues, and use them as a tool in forecasting ecosystem changes and options for mitigation.

SLiCA itself is an interdisciplinary and international research project, which was founded in 1998. The two major objectives are (1) to develop a new research design for measurement of living conditions and individual well-being among the Inuit and Saami peoples in the Arctic and the indigenous peoples of Chukotka reflecting the welfare priorities of the indigenous peoples and (2) to carry out a survey of living conditions among these peoples. The project is developed in partnership with the indigenous peoples organisations. SLiCA has accomplished the first objective and finished data collection in Canada, Alaska, and Chukotka. By the end of 2006 data collection will be completed also in Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola Peninsula. The data material will consist of approximately 8.000 personal interviews.

In 2005 and 2006 SLiCA is focusing on achieving two main objectives of the project concluding analyses and publishing the findings of the analyses. An additional main objective of the project is to make the international data set available to the scientific and indigenous communities of the Arctic as well as to political and administrative decision makers at the local, regional, national and international levels. The original project scope called for the development of a micro data set that could be shared with these communities. Our analyses to date have revealed a major challenge associated with this approach. The protection of the confidentiality of respondents requires collapsing of response categories for such variables as location (e.g. place), occupation, and income. While we anticipated the need for collapsing response categories, we did not anticipate the degree to which this would pose a constraint for multivariate analyses. We further realize that the challenge of providing analytically robust social science data sets and protecting the confidentiality of respondents is common in the Arctic social sciences. We therefore propose to contribute to the IPY goal of expanding our understanding of human dimensions of change in the Arctic by collaborating with an international team to apply and extend the concepts of remote access analysis to the SLiCA international database.

The objective of Remote Access Analysis is to provide researchers with access to a micro data set for analysis (i.e. the individual records of respondents to the SLiCA questionnaire) from their own computers. This capability is particularly valuable in the Arctic given the dispersed character of the scientific and indigenous communities and local political and administrative authorities. We further propose to extend this capability to work with restricted datasets where the sensitivity of data is sufficiently high to warrant restriction of access to the raw data. Researchers and indigenous organizations as well as political and administrative authorities at different levels will be able to conduct analyses while making it impossible to view the micro data set itself. To accomplish these objectives, the SLiCA international team is collaborating with the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan and the Computer-assisted Survey Methods Program (CSM) at the University of California, Berkeley.

Consistent with the IPY goal of fostering a major step forward in our understanding of the human dimensions of change in the Arctic, we propose to have the SLiCA Remote Access Analysis System in place for the 2008 International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences, ICASS VI (endorsed by the ICSU/WMO Joint Committee for the International Polar Year 2007-2008 as an IPY activity), of the International Arctic Social Sciences Association, IASSA. We will provide a demonstration of the System and a training seminar in the use of the system at the conference.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
APL deployed the Flare Genesis Experiment (FGE) in Antarctica to
provide the sharpest view ever obtained of the evolution of activity
in the solar atmosphere. FGE is a balloon-borne solar telescope with
an 80-cm telescope that will supply 0.2 arcsec images to a vector
magnetograph to map photospheric and chromospheric magnetic
fields. The experiment will advance basic scientific understanding of
the mechanism of solar variability and provide the practical
engineering experience needed for building a large solar observatory
in space. Flare Genesis will operate in uninterrupted sunlight well
above the turbulent layers of the atmosphere at 125,000 feet to take
high-resolution photographs. On-board tape recorders holding 90
gigabytes will collect 110,000 images, and the communications system
will relay several thousand images to the ground.

FGE has completed its test flight and has been successfully integrated
with the NSBF package. The pointing system surpasses the design goal
of 10 arcsec rms jitter, and H-alpha images from the Target Selector
Telescope and limb photos through the main telescope have been
recorded. FGE utilizes several innovative APL developed systems, such
as the silicon retina with a fast tilt-tip mirror for image motion
compensation and APL's FRISC microcontroller.

From January 10 to 27, 2000, the Flare Genesis solar telescope
observed the Sun while suspended from a balloon in the stratosphere
above Antarctica. The goal of the mission was to acquire long time
series of high-resolution images and vector magnetograms of the solar
photosphere and chromosphere. Images were obtained in the magnetically
sensitive Ca I line at 6122 Angstroms and at H-alpha (6563
Angstroms). The FGE data were obtained in the context of Max
Millennium Observing Campaign #004, the objective of which was to
study the ``Genesis of Solar Flares and Active Filaments/Sigmoids."
Flare Genesis obtained about 26,000 usable images on the 8 targeted
active regions. A preliminary examination reveals a good sequence on
an emerging flux region and data on the M1 flare on January 22, as
well as a number of sequences on active filaments. We will present the
results of our first analysis efforts. Flare Genesis was supported by
NASA grants NAG5-4955, NAG5-5139, and NAG5-8331 and by NSF grant
OPP-9615073. The Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization supported early development of
the Flare Genesis Experiment.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Towards an international astronomical observatory at Dome C in Antarctica</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: STELLA ANTARCTICA
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=385

Dome C in Antarctica is potentially the best astronomical site in the world, with conditions close to space for some atmospheric windows. An extensive site testing program at the Concordia French-Italian station is underway. Comprehensive results of this program will be available during the year 2007. Small-scale astronomical experiments should also give their first results during the IPY. In 2007, astronomers will then be able to target precisely the best scientific and observational niches for astronomy at Dome C. A European network (coordinated action in the frame of the Large Research Infrastructure Research Programme's of EEC), named ARENA has just started in January, 2006, and is devoted to this task. Among the observational niches, some are already clearly identified : submillimeter wavelengths, high angular resolution, as well as Wide field IR and optical observations, and continuous observations over days or weeks. The IPY offers a unique opportunity to discuss with national and international agencies the frame for a large astronomical infrastructure in Antarctica and to undertake its development.

The development of astronomy at Dome C, for which several French and international teams (Italy, Australia, China, Germany, United Kingdom) have expressed their interest, has to be carried out in several steps. The next two years (2006-2007) will be devoted to the completion of the site characterization in Summer and Winter. The development of small astronomical experiments will additionally provide a good overview of the specific operational constraints that any observatory will face on this site. 

In the meantime, the polar institutes and astronomical agencies involved in the Concordia station (INAF and PNRA in Italy, IPEV and INSU in France) will discuss, in collaboration with the Arena consortium, whether and how they wish to open officially Concordia to more international collaborations with the long-term goal of an international ambitious observatory on the site. The frame for international collaborations should ideally be determined before end 2006.

On the scientific side, in 2006 and 2007 several workshops and symposia at the national and international levels will be organized with the aims to survey the scientific topics that can be addressed by polar astronomy. 

Our goals during the IPY are then:
-to define the strategy for a development of astronomy at Dome C, 
-to propose it to the agencies and to have it endorsed, 
-and to increase and develop the funding process. 
This strategy should be based on the scientific questions that will benefit most from this exceptional site. It should aim at ambitious experiments: if indeed for some questions Dome C is the best site on Earth, we should build there the best possible telescope with the best instrumentation. 
The legacy of STELLA ANTARCTICA will then be a development plan for an international astronomical observatory at Dome C. This plan will have been endorsed by a consortium of national and international agencies, and its funding secured, possibly through actions of the European FP7, and possibly bilateral agreements with countries outside the EU. 
What can be foreseen is a development plan in two major steps:
- A first step at the European scale, taking advantage of the existing Concordia station and the capabilities of the present Italo-French logistics. Such a European scale astronomical project could be considered in a range of 10-20 M during the next 5 to 10 years.
- The second step could be much more ambitious and target a world wide astronomical project in the range of 500-1000 M. That will also imply a change of scale of the complete logistics, and must be considered at an horizon of the order of 20 years. Concordia would have then become one of the major world astronomical facilities, and be in the position of playing a key role, like among others, answering one of the fundamental mankind questions: where else in the Universe can Life have developed.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Remote Sensing generally refers to the science, technology and physical processes involved in the detection, analysis and interpretation of information collected without coming into physical contact with the object of interest. In the context of our research and applications, urban remote sensing focuses primarily on understanding the physical properties and processes of urban environments and on the mapping and monitoring of urban land cover and spatial extent. These two objectives are related in the sense that it is necessary to understand the physical properties of the urban mosaic in order to rigorously define, map and monitor urban areas.

The research presented at SEDAC is primarily focused on the physical properties of a wide range of urban environments using passive measurement of optical reflectance and thermal emission as well as optical emission of nighttime lights. Comparative analyses of urban reflectance (visible and infrared color) and surface temperature allow us to develop robust criteria for distinguishing urban land cover from non-anthropogenic land covers. These analyses also provide important constraints on the physical properties that control mass and energy fluxes through the urban environment. These constraints are used as inputs to physical models of climatic, hydrologic and ecologic processes.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Florida Institute of Oceanography's (FIO) SEAKEYS (Sustained
Ecological Research Related to Management of the Florida
Keys Seascape) program began in 1989 and has continued
until the present. This program, now being supported through NOAA's
South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, Prediction and Modeling Program
(SFERPM), implements a framework for long-term monitoring and research
along the 220 mile Florida coral reef tract and in Florida Bay at a
geographical scale encompassing the Florida Keys National Marine
Sanctuary (FKNMS). The impetus for such a framework was the perceived
marked regional decline in coral reefs and the critical need to
provide data and options for resource management. The network consists
of six instrument-enhanced Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN)
stations, cooperatively managed with NOAA's National Data Buoy Center,
plus a proposed new one in northwest Florida Bay. These stations
measure the usual C-MAN meteorological parameters, such as wind speed,
gusts and barometric pressure, but are enhanced with oceanographic
instruments measuring salinity, sea temperature, fluorometry and turbidity.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The North American Carbon Program (NACP) is a multidisciplinary research program designed to obtain scientific understanding of North America's carbon sources and sinks and of changes in carbon stocks needed to meet societal concerns and to provide too tools for decision makers. Successful execution of the NACP will require an unprecedented level of coordination among observational, experimental, and modeling efforts regarding terrestrial, oceanic, atmospheric, and human components. NACP will rely upon a rich and diverse array of existing observational networks, monitoring sites, and experimental field studies in North America and its adjacent oceans.

NACP Intensive Field Campaigns

The North American Carbon Program (NACP) conducts intensive experimental field campaigns to:

    * address specific science issues, questions, and hypotheses
    * develop and test methods and models
    * calibrate and validate remote sensing observations relevant to NACP objectives
    * produce critical data and analyses

NACP intensive campaigns address specific, challenging issues that are critical to the success of the overall program. Typically, intensive campaigns require unusual concentrations of resources, and other major program elements depend on their timely completion.

The ORNL DAAC is currently in the process of archiving initial NACP data sets. This will be a continuous process, so check here frequently for updates.

The LBA-ECO component focuses on the question: "How do tropical forest conversion, regrowth, and selective logging influence carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes, and the prospect for sustainable land use in Amazonia?" 

The Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is the largest remaining expanse of tropical rain forest on Earth, harboring approximately one-third of all Earth's species. Although the jungle's area is so large that it reaches out into several different countries, most of its area is located within the Brazilian territory. Despite three centuries of scientific study in Amazonia, only a small fraction of its biological richness has been revealed.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE) program was initiated
as an effort to produce an autonomous system for measuring water vapor
levels from airborne and spaceborne platforms using LIDAR technology.

      Objectives include:

      1. Develop and demonstrate autonomous DIAL systems from airborne
      and spaceborne platforms.

      2. Measure water vapor, aerosol, and cloud profiles from a high
      altitude extended range U-2 (ER-2) aircraft.

      Use of experiment:

      1. Studies of air mass modification
      2. Studies of latent heatflux
      3. Studies of the water vapor component of the hydrological
      cycle
      4. Studies of atmospheric transport using water vapor as a
      tracer of atmospheric motions

The simultaneous measurement of aerosol and cloud distributions can
provide important information on atmospheric structure and transport,
and many meteorological parameters can also be inferred from these
data. In addition, the impact of subvisible and visible aerosol/cloud
layers on passive satellite measurements and radiation budgets can be
assessed. The atmospheric science investigations that can be conducted
with LASE are greatly enhanced because measurements of water vapor
profiles and column content are made simultaneously with aerosol and
cloud distributions

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The International GNSS Service (IGS), formerly the International GPS Service, is a voluntary federation of more than 200 worldwide agencies that pool resources and permanent GPS and GLONASS station data to generate precise GNSS products. The IGS is committed to providing the highest quality data and products as the standard for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in support of Earth science research, multidisciplinary applications, and education. Currently the IGS includes two GNSS, GPS and the Russian GLONASS, and intends to incorporate future GNSS. The IGS collects, archives, and distributes GNSS observation data sets of sufficient accuracy to satisfy the objectives of a wide range of applications and experimentation. These data sets are used by the IGS to generate the data products (high accuracy GNSS satellite ephemerides, Earth rotation parameters, coordinates and velocities of the IGS tracking stations, GNSS satellite and tracking station clock information, timescale products, ionospheric and tropospheric information). In particular, the accuracies of IGS products are sufficient for the improvement and extension of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), the monitoring of solid Earth deformations, the monitoring of Earth rotation and variations in the liquid Earth (sea level, ice-sheets, etc.), for scientific satellite orbit determinations, ionosphere monitoring, and recovery of precipitable water vapor measurements. These activities endeavor to advance scientific understanding of the Earth system components and their interactions, as well as to facilitate other applications benefiting society. The Service also develops the necessary standards and specifications and encourages international adherence to its conventions.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A consortium of groups, led by International Council for Science's Committee on Data for Science and Technology (ICSU-CODATA) Global Roads Data Development Working Group, is developing a digital, public domain global road map under the name Global Roads Open Access Data Set (gROADS).   gROADS will be:

- globally consistent (in terms of the underlying data model and attribute coding);
- spatially accurate (~50m positional accuracy);
- topologically integrated;
- suitable for mapping at an approximate scale of 1:250,000;
- focused on roads between settlements (not streets);
- up-to-date and with the possibility of frequent updates;
- well documented; and
- freely distributed (on an "attribution only" basis). 

The gROADS initiative is sponsored by CODATA, is an approved task of the UN-GAID e-SDDC (UN Global Alliance on ICT for Development Open Access to and Application of Scientific Data in Developing Countries), and is endorsed by the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Association (GSDI) and GISCorps of the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (URISA).  In addition, the roads data development activity has also been listed as sub-task EC-09-02(a), "Human Dimension of Ecosystem Utilization and Conservation," of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) 2009-2011 Work Plan.   Finally, gROADS is linked into the United Nations Spatial Data Infrastructure (UNSDI) through its adoption of the UNSDI-Transport (UNSDI-T) data model.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=455

This proposal is being submitted to the IPY committee by northerners for the benefit of northerners. Being a resident of the arctic, I clearly understand the utter need for practical research that will help to strengthen and improve the health and well-being of community life, and will contribute to making our communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.

At the 2006 World Urban Forum it was acknowledged by global decision-makers that climate change will be one of the key challenges faced by human settlements across the world. The goal of this research node is to build capacity for sustainable community development in Arctic regions so they are less vulnerable, more liveable and stand a better chance of coping with challenges posed by climate change. In the Arctic, building this capacity requires a proactive approach, collaboration amongst a wide range of partners, integration of policies across scales (national, regional, local), accommodation of cultural priorities, and practical application of research. 

This is reflected in the 2005 Research Needs Survey for Nunavut published by C-CIARN North. It states:
The survey results suggest that Nunavut community members recognize considerable overlap among climate change impacts and that they do not generally view climate change adaptation challenges in isolation of other social and environmental pressures. Local climate change pressures need to reflect this holistic perspective, and focus largely on understanding the interactions and cumulative effects of climate change and a host of other factors such as resource development, rapid social change, population growth, health decline, educational achievement, long range contaminant transport, and other factors.

Clearly there is a growing need for the practical application of research on the uncertainty, challenges, and impacts of climate change on Arctic communities. However, in the Arctic there is a large gap between scientific research and building capacity for sustainable development.

This research will contribute practical results to climate change impact and adaptation research, provide examples of mitigation and contribute to the improving the health and well-being of Arctic communities. Areas of focus will be on housing design, building technology, alternative energy, community planning, waste management and capacity building. The current housing situation in many Arctic communities is one of severe overcrowding and complete reliance on diesel fuel for energy needs. This situation is leading to negative mental and physical health problems to individuals and leaving communities vulnerable to rising fuel prices. 

Research under this activity cluster will take a much needed holistic approach to creating more environmentally friendly, affordable and culturally responsible housing options that positively contribute to the health and well-being of northern-based communities. Increased Arctic planning capacity will be needed in order to maintain community resiliency. This will require the integration of traditional knowledge and scientific research and involve Inuit, First Nation/Aboriginal groups, northerners, community planners, and scientists in different regions of the Arctic.

Collaboration will involve Arctic and national governments, northern and southern-based organizations, and Arctic communities.

Two of the strains, identified as Pseudomonas spp., degraded C5 to C12 n-alkanes, toluene, and naphthalene at both 5 and 25 degrees C and possessed both the alk catabolic pathway for alkane biodegradation and the nah catabolic pathway for polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. One of these strains contained both a plasmid slightly smaller than the P. oleovorans OCT plasmid, which hybridized to an alkB gene probe, and a NAH plasmid similar to NAH7, demonstrating that both catabolic pathways, located on separate plasmids, can naturally coexist in the same bacterium.

The Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team, located at the U.S.
Geological Survey's Eros Data Center, is accessible via the World Wide Web:
'http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/sast/sast-home.html'
The SAST maintains the SAST Database of Environmental data for the
Upper Mississippi and Missouri River Basins.
The following information about the SAST project was abstracted from the
SAST home page:
Through a directive from the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy, an interdisciplinary Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team
(SAST) was formed "to provide scientific advice and assistance to Federal
officials responsible for making decisions with respect to flood recovery
in the Upper Mississippi River and Missouri River Basins, and to develop
and provide information to support the decision making process regarding
both nonstructural and structural approaches to river basin management."
The team included scientific specialists from the Soil Conservation
Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, National
Biological Survey, U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection
Agency, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In-depth technical
and scientific support is provided by the U.S. Geological Survey's Earth
Resources Observation System (EROS) Data Center and its in-house
contractor, Hughes STX Corporation.
Over a period of 3 months at the EROS Data Center, the team developed a
substantial Environmental Information System for the Upper Mississippi and
Missouri River Basins. This system includes satellite data, elevation
data, digitized aerial photographs, data on historic river channels,
man-made structures, hazardous/toxic waste sites, spatially referenced
information on soils, and various geologic, biologic, hydrologic, and
hydrographic themes. The component data sets were designed for widely
different purposes, and were received in a variety of formats and map
scales. Data were edited, reformatted, and carefully documented to provide
consistency and accuracy for analysis based on overlay and mensuration.
The majority of data were provided by Federal agencies, and are in the
public domain. These will be available for release to the public for the
cost of distribution. A small number of data sets have distribution
restrictions due to proprietary agreements or to protect resources at
sensitive locations such as archaeologic sites or endangered species
nesting areas. Data sets will be managed and maintained at various sites
and will be distributed using Internet access as part of a clearinghouse
function. One approach to Internet access involves Mosaic software and
World-Wide Web services. Application of Mosaic hypertext provides a
window-based browser environment allowing interested persons to read or
download documents, graphics, and data layers.
In describing the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), the Federal
Geographic Data Committee said, "Geospatial data form the foundation of an
information-based society" (Nancy Tosta, NSDI, written commun., May,
1993). The SAST has provided a prototype for the development, planning,
creation, and distribution of a quality environmental information system
for the Federal Geographic Data Committee's National Spatial Data
Infrastructure.

the Mackenzie River Basin in northern Canada. It is being conducted by
a network of Canadian government and university scientists supported
by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of
Canada, Environment Canada, and other government and industrial
partners.

The goal of MAGS is to improve our understanding of the water and
energy cycle of the Mackenzie River Basin in particular and of cold
regions in general. One its major objectives is to develop coupled
models of the atmospheric and hydrological processes of the Mackenzie
River Basin that can be used to evaluate the impact of both
human-induced climate change and natural climate variability on
Canada's water resources.

MAGS is also an important Canadian contribution to the Global Water

The objective of the WAVEMOD project is to develop a probabilistic
methodology for coastal site investigations. The methodology allows
integration of complex or irregular phenomena through a combination of
physical insight and statistical analysis of actual observations. A
probabilistic approach to derive the design conditions for coastal
engineering problems, developments of stocastic models of waves and
current parameters and integration of existing data with new
measurements and mathematical models are the main topics of the
project.

Wave directional meeasurements were carried out off the coast of

To attain this goal, ACSYS seeks to develop and co-ordinate national and international Arctic science activities aimed at the three main objectives. 

Understanding the interactions between the Arctic Ocean circulation, ice cover, the atmosphere and the hydrological cycle.  Initiating long-term climate research and monitoring programmes for the Arctic.  Providing a scientific basis for an accurate representation of Arctic processes in global climate models.  The rational for the ACSYS proposal is the expectation that a consolidated science and implementation plan, based on a broad scientific consensus, will constitute a sound justification for the provision of adequate resources and logistics to carry out research on the Arctic climate system. The project's framework includes several programs.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A coupled ice/ocean dynamics model is developed to provide Arctic offshore operators with 5- to 7-day forecasts of ice motions, ice conditions, and ice edge motions. An adaptive grid is introduced to follow the ice edge, and the grid may move independently of the ice motion. The grid can be Lagrangian or Eulerian at different locations away from the ice edge. Ice stress is described using an elastic-plastic model with strength determined by the ice conditions. The ocean dynamics model describes time-dependent, three-dimensional behavior, including wind-driven currents and barotropic and baroclinic flows.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The BIOMASS Programme was established in the late 1970's for the study
of the Antarctic marine ecosystem and its living resources. Data
were collected during 3 major field experiments between 1981 and
1985. The first focused on extended spatial coverage, whilst the
second and third were concerned with repeat sampling at pre-defined
locations to give a temporal sequence. Data collected from these
field experiments were transferred to a central BIOMASS Data Centre
to enable their standardisation for integrated analysis. The Data
Centre was also responsible for running a series of data analysis
workshops. With the end of the BIOMASS Programme in 1991, the data
set and its supporting documentation are being prepared for
distribution to those scientists who took part in BIOMASS and to any
other investigators who request copies. The BIOMASS Data Centre
faced many problems in standardising, integrating and documenting
the data supplied by individual researchers into a coherent data!
set. The majority of these problems were managerial rather than
technical. There was a lack of integration of the data management
with the objectives of the science programme. For example, the need
for a BIOMASS Data Centre was identified in 1979, but it was not
finally established until 1986. Once established, the Data Centre
did not always respond to the scientific requirements of the
programme. There was an over reliance on software that was developed
within the Data Centre instead of using commercially available
products. Time was spent creating and testing software, which would
have been better spent supporting data analysis.

Problems were experienced in persuading individual researchers to
contribute data to the Data Centre. Researchers often found that the
effort involved in submitting their data to the Data Centre was much
greater than the benefits they gained. Ensuring that the data were
validated and of the required quality was also difficult. The task was
hampered by the lack of supporting information about the data
themselves (the meta-data). Restricted access to certain data sets
reduced the effectiveness of the BIOMASS Data Centre and it operated
for much of its life with a very restrictive data access
protocol. This was designed to protect some data sets before their
originators had published their own analyses, but hampered the
distribution of data to the wider BIOMASS community.

The lessons that have been learned from BIOMASS about the management
of complex, large-scale, biological data sets will be of great use to
future programmes. Increasing the quality of data holdings, especially
by the inclusion of meta-data, will increase the chances of
successfully networking databases together to support biodiversity and
other research.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">U.S. GLOBEC (GLOBal ocean ECosystems dynamics, http://www.usglobec.org/) is a
research program organized by oceanographers and fisheries scientists to
address the question of how global climate change may affect the abundance and
production of animals in the sea.  The U.S. GLOBEC Program currently has major
research efforts underway in the Georges Bank / Northwest Atlantic Region, and
the Northeast Pacific (with components in the California Current and in the
Coastal Gulf of Alaska).

U.S. GLOBAL OCEAN ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS, GEORGES BANK

The U.S. GLOBEC Georges Bank Program is a large multidisciplinary multi-year
oceanographic effort. The proximate goal is to understand the population
dynamics of key species on the Bank - Cod, Haddock, and two species of
zooplankton - in terms of their coupling to the physical environment and in
terms of their predators and prey. The ultimate goal is to be able to predict
changes in the distribution and abundance of these species as a result of
changes in their physical and biotic environment as well as to anticipate how
their populations might respond to climate change.

The effort is substantial, requiring
-broad-scale surveys of the entire Bank, and
-process studies which focus both on
  -the links between the target species and their physical environment, and
  -the determination of fundamental aspects of these species' life history
(birth rates, growth rates, death rates, etc).

Equally important are the modelling efforts that are ongoing which seek to
provide realistic predictions of the flow field and which utilize the life
history information to produce an integrated view of the dynamics of the
populations.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Classical optical determinations of Earth rotation (UT1) require several weeks of observations to achieve an accuracy of approx1.5 ms of time, whereas modern techniques have demonstrated an accuracy of 0.7−0.9 ms on timescales of 1−5 days l,2. Here we have probed the limits of the accuracy and time resolution of very long baseline inteferometry (VLBI) determinations of UT1 by conducting a series of 1-h observing sessions using only one baseline. Comparison of the results from the 1-h sessions with corresponding determinations from 24-h multi-baseline sessions establishes that the accuracy of the 1-h determinations is close to 0.1 ms of time. These observations were scheduled as part of the project MERIT (monitor earth rotation and intercompare techniques of observation and analysis3) intensive observing campaign.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The NASA Aqua and Japanese ADEOS-II Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Programs are committed to developing and providing daily soil moisture products. This is the first time that this challenging task has ever been attempted.

The wide range of vegetation conditions that have to be dealt with, due to the global coverage and multi-temporal observations, exceed those that have been evaluated in previous investigations.

For these reasons, validation is critical to the AMSR soil moisture product development and acceptance.

SMEX03 will provide validation data for a wide range of vegetation conditions ranging from well understood grass and wheat in Oklahoma to new observations of the Amazon rainforests. In addition it will provide a test bed for other new satellite instruments such as the Envisat ASAR and aircraft based prototype satellite instruments.

SMEX03 will be conducted at U.S. sites in Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama in June and July and Brazil in December.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project, VEMAP,
is a multi-institutional, international effort whose goal is to
evaluate the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystem and vegetation
processes to altered climate forcing and elevated atmospheric
CO2.

Objectives:

1. Comparison of model output for current conditions

2. Intercomparison of the climate and CO2 sensitivity of three
biogeochemistry models (plant production and soil biogeochemical
process models) and three vegetation lifeform distribution
models (biogeography models).

3. Linking vegetation distribution and ecosystem physiology
models to evaluate the joint response of these processes to
altered conditions.

VEMAP is supported by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) ,
NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) , and USDA Forest Service
Southern Global Change Program. Development of the VEMAP
database was additionally supported by the National Science
Foundation's Climate Dynamics Program through the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research's Climate System Modeling
Program.

The Dataset:

Phase I consists of a database of a model database of climate,
soils, and vegetation compatible with the requirements of three
ecosystem physiology models and three vegetation lifeform
distribution models. The database is on a 0.5 degree
latitude/longitude grid for the conterminous United States.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">AIRSTREAM</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Airstream began with a single man and a most singular dream. The man was Wally Byam: his dream, to build the perfect travel trailer. One that would move like a stream of air. One that would be light enough to be towed by a standard automobile. One that would provide first-class living accommodations anywhere in the world. Thus, over 70 years ago was born the first Airstream trailer. And with it was born yet another dream, a dream of new freedom, new places, new experiences, and new friendships. It was a dream so powerful, so enduring it did far more than create a new way of travel; it created a new way of life shared by thousands upon thousands of families.

The Airstream philosophy has always been and will always be, " Let's not make any changes — let's make only improvements!" Every inch of an Airstream has a functional purpose. There is no planned obsolescence. This is as true in today's models as it was of the first Airstream to see the light of the open road. The classic Airstream of the thirties is no museum piece. Still in use today, it is as sturdy and modern in appearance as the first day it swung into traffic. As a result, an Airstream is always "in style' — conceived and constructed as a lifetime investment in happiness.

Today, the Airstream is the most thoroughly tested Airstream in trailer history. It is years ahead in engineering — the culmination of over 70 years of experience in trailer making, millions of miles of Caravan travel throughout the world; plus millions of miles more, run up by happy Airstream owners! More than ever, the Airstream remains a testimonial to the practical vision, the tenacity and know-how of one dedicated man — Wally Byam, and his team who made your travel dreams come true.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition 41</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

In phase I the participants spent 47days sailing with hard work and rough seas, and the diet was rich in fat and poor in fresh foods. In this phase, glucose decreased and HDL-cholesterol, apo-AI, and TSH increased. Plasma retinol and α-tocopherol levels remained stable, γ-tocopherol, α-carotene and β-carotene significantly decreased, and lycopene significantly increased. Phase II lasted 49days including a 7-day long stop in port. This meant that a more varied diet was available and fresh foods were present in the hold. There was also less extreme physical activity. The metabolic pattern changed direction, glucose rose, HDL-cholesterol and apo-AI decreased and the levels of the vitamins that dropped in phase I started to increase. Lycopene significantly decreased.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Calibration / Validation of met and climate models and remote sensing algos</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The ongoing global climate change has a complex signature in Antarctica. The set-back of the stratospheric ozone hole (Montreal protocol), natural variability cycles (Antarctic oscillation), a complex contribution by the southern ocean, presently result in a delayed response on a large part of the continent (east Antarctica) but a strong signature elsewhere (Peninsula, Weddell and Belingshausen sectors).

It is very likely that climate changes in the course of the present century will be significant over Antarctica (Krinner et al. 2007, Genthon et al. 2009) but the magnitude and detailed chronology of this change remains to be firmly established. Climate change over Antarctica will affect mass balance and thus sea-level with global consequences.

Therefore, it is important to make sure that meteorological and climate models used to predict climate and mass balance change over Antarctica are calibrated and validated with proper field data. Such observation is necessarily of limited spatial and to some extent temporal significance. It is thus important to also improve our ability to exploit satellite information to inter- and extrapolate the field data to scales compatible with models and more generally to the full scale of Antarctica. A main point about the present [CALVA] project is is that it jointly coordinates field activities in support of both climate models and satellite remote sensing.


The objectives of the project CALVA is to deploy, maintain and exploit a set of automatic autonomous instrumental systems, to carry manual observations on the field , and to participate in special observing campaigns to improve calibration of and validate analysis and forecast climate models and satellite data processing algorithms. Selection of necessary data and of methods to acquire the data are thus determined by the common and specific needs of models and remote sensing.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      The objective of this project is to continue the study of Antarctic
      bacteria able to produce exoenzymes with high activity at low
      temperatures and evaluate their potential industrial application. In
      addition, owing to the ecological relevance of these bacterial
      activities, we decided to make a broad study of the ... bacterial
      communities from which these strains were isolated. Screenings of
      psychrophilic bacteria will be made using selective culture media (in
      Petri dishes or liquid cultures) that permit us to detect the desired
      enzymatic activities (proteases, amylases, lipases, etc). Strains
      showing the desired activity will be studied to determine their
      psychrophilic character and to optimise the extracellular enzymes
      production under different culture. Subsequently, purification and
      characterisation of the enzymes showing the biotechnological
      potential will be performed. Taxonomic studies will be made by
      sequencing 16S rARN gene and bacterial communities will be analyzed
      using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and restriction
      fragments length polymorphism (RFLP). Due to the interest showed by
      many biotechnological industries in the metabolic capabilities of
      these extremophilic microorganisms agreements are being established in
      order to develop studies about the industrial application of the
      genome sequence and the products of these isolated strains.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=167

The Arctic Human Health Initiative (AHHI) is an IPY (2007-2008) Arctic Council project that aims to increase the visibility and awareness of health concerns of Arctic peoples, to foster human health research, and promote health protection strategies that will improve the health and well-being of all Arctic Residents. The AHHI core project will seek to advance the joint circumpolar human health research agendas of the Arctic Council (AC; www.arcticcouncil.org ), an eight nation intergovernmental forum for sustainable development and environmental protection, and the working groups of the International Union for Circumpolar Health (IUCH). Current AC human health activities include monitoring the human health impact of anthropogenic pollutants, climate variability, infectious diseases, and the expansion and assessment of tele-health innovations in Arctic regions. The IUCH (www.iuch.org ) promotes international cooperation, research, scientific information exchange and education in the areas of Arctic Health Policy, Birth Defects &amp; Genetics, Cancer, Diet &amp; Heart, Environmental Health &amp; Subsistence Food Security, Family Health, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Health Surveys, HIV/AIDS, STDs, Indigenous Peoples Health, Infectious Diseases, Injury Prevention, Occupational Safety &amp; Health, Population-Based Planning, Tobacco &amp; Health, and Women's Health. An anticipated outcome of the AHHI will be the development of an organizational infrastructure for the coordination of human health research activities in Arctic regions. 

A key element of the AHHI will be the development of new, and expansion of existing human health surveillance, monitoring and research networks. These circumpolar networks will allow the monitoring of diseases of concern in Arctic communities through the development of standardized study protocols, data collection, laboratory methods, and data analysis. Once established these networks will allow the monitoring of disease prevalence over time, the determination of risk factors for disease and evaluation and implementation of disease prevention and control strategies. Networks also provide opportunities for the development of sustainable partnerships between communities and researcher through the establishment of community-based monitoring activities. 

A focus of the AHHI is the establishment of research activities focusing on human health issues of concern to Arctic residents. Priority areas include the human health impact of: 
-Regional and inter-continentally transported anthropogenic pollution in Arctic regions.
-Oil, gas and other sustainable development activities. 
-Contaminants and zoonotic infectious diseases on the traditional food supply.
-Climate variability on human health and traditional food supply. 
-Infectious diseases including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, vaccine preventable diseases, emerging infectious diseases such as SARS.
-The effects of the changing Arctic environment on the evolution, ecology, and emergence of zoonotic disease, particularly avian influenza.
-Chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes. 
-Behavioural health issues, such as suicide, interpersonal violence and substance abuse, and unintentional injuries. 
Research activities will include the use of culturally sensitive health interview surveys which are a useful tool for characterizing health and risky behaviours, the health status of populations, and the development of culturally appropriate interventions. 

In the area of health communication several symposia and topic specific work shops are planned before during and following IPY which will allow the, development of new collaborations, evaluation of advances made in the health of Arctic peoples, the health disparities that remain, and to examine future risks to the health and well-being of all Arctic residents.

The Russian-American Initiative on Shelf-Land Environments in the
Arctic (RAISE) facilitates collaborative research between Russian and
American scientists studying terrestrial, shelf, and ocean
environments in northern Eurasia in the context of global
change. RAISE is a multi-disciplinary initiative aimed at integrating
scientific understanding of global change in the Arctic at the
land-sea boundary over prehistoric, historic, and current time
frames. An international scientific steering committee promotes this
effort, and a project office, located at the University of Alaska in
Fairbanks, provides research support.

The following research problems, identified during scientific
workshops supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the
Russian Fund for Basic Research, led to the development of the RAISE
program:

1. Among the great unknowns in climate prediction is the potential for
release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane from
peat and permafrost as climate warms at higher latitudes. Some of the
largest coastal erosion rates in the world are already occurring in
the Russian Arctic, and the ultimate transport and fate of resultant
large fluxes of organic carbon into the Arctic Ocean are poorly
understood.

2. The volume of river runoff in the Arctic may also be altered by
global change, and changes in the freshwater content of the Arctic
Ocean are likely to have consequences for formation of sea ice cover
and thermohaline circulation over the Arctic-North Atlantic climate
system.

3. The retreat of sea ice over the vast Eurasian continental shelves
will also have direct impacts on biological productivity, will
affect marine mammals and birds, and, ultimately, will impact
subsistence communities in both Russia and Alaska who depend
upon current climate and hydrographic patterns.

Project URL: http://ipy.antarctica.gov.au/projects/solar-variability-linkages-to-atmospheric-processes
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=56

Solar variability influences the atmosphere, particularly the global electric circuit and ozone. We propose an IPY cluster to quantify solar variability linkages to weather, climate and ozone.

The geoelectric circuit links weather and solar activity. It remains an open and a scientifically achievable goal to determine whether or not this linkage is passive or involves active coupling i.e., whether the global circuit merely responds to both meteorological and solar variations, or whether there is an active input to weather and climate via electrically induced changes in cloud microphysics. Present research indicates that the best place to measure the global circuit is the Antarctic plateau (high, dry, relatively meteorologically stable). The Greenland plateau provides an ideal northern hemisphere site. We propose making simultaneous vertical electric field and air-earth current measurements at a range of polar sites (plans presently envisage measurements at Vostok, South Pole and Concordia, 78S 24W, 84S 26W and 75S 70W). We encourage and seek to promote development of further sites, particularly in the northern polar regions. 

A model of the global circuit is being developed that incorporates spatially and temporally varying global ion production due to the solar wind modulation of galactic cosmic rays, globally varying tropospheric and stratospheric aerosol concentrations and ion production in the stratosphere from relativistic electron precipitation and solar energetic particle events. It is also planned to insert the polar-cap potential distribution driven by solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling into this model. We propose to compare the model and measurements to quantify limits on the hypothesis that the geoelectric circuit provides a viable path for a sun-weather linkage. Measurements indicate that the geoelectric circuit is sustained by both thunderstorm activity and electrified clouds. Published evidence exists that global thunderstorm activity has a multiplicative dependency on equatorial surface temperatures. Simultaneous measurements of the DC circuit and of power in the Schumann resonance bands may provide sensitive independent proxy monitors for both an equatorially-weighted, global temperature and rainfall. Our team includes a scientist making mid-latitude ELF/VLF measurements recording global lightning activity. We encourage measurements of Schumann resonance power and VLF-lightning data. We propose to determine how accurately our measurements can be used as proxy monitors, and to provide an accurate reference measurement of the geoelectric circuit in the IPY era.

Ground-based geoelectric instrumentation on the Antarctic Plateau has recently been used to confirm that broad-scale polar ionospheric convection potentials can be measured independent of the existence of small scale ionospheric irregularities. Our multiple polar-plateau geoelectric field measurements will contribute to understanding and monitoring polar-cap ionospheric convection. 

The circumpolar vortex surrounding Antarctica is typical of the southern polar regions under winter conditions. This strong circumpolar vortex blocks lower latitude, ozone-rich air from reaching central Antarctica. In combination with the lack of solar insolation in winter, the total ozone content above the southern polar regions decreases dramatically. The depth of the so-called ozone hole and its rate of filling in spring depends on the previous state of the atmosphere and has been shown to be affected by external influences related to solar activity. The relative effects of the influences of short-term changes in cosmic ray intensity, variations of the interplanetary electric field on atmospheric parameters (temperature and pressure) in the southern winter polar regions, the dynamics of the ozone layer, the effects of solar UV radiation and the role of the global electric circuit on winter-spring Antarctic ozone concentrations will be examined. A study of pulsed cosmophysical signals in the Arctic (Barentzburg) and in Antarctica (Novolazarevskaya) is proposed. Measurments at Novolazarevskaya have revealed the regular occurrence of pulsed signals in the solar spectrum. The most pronounced pulses have been detected 4 days ahead of solar flare proton events (SPE). Results of the analysis of the spatial-temporal anisotropy of the cosmological signals will be used for derivation of an empirical model and to study the solar sources and mechanism of the pulsed irradiation. Study of the effects of the pulsed radiation on biological and technogenic systems is also planned.Most of our team are actively involved in enthusing students and educating the public. The geoelectric circuit with its link to thunderstorms, sprites, climate change and a sun-weather hypothesis provides considerable scope for such activities. Polar convection studies additionally provide a neat link of this proposed IPY activity with the geophysical focus of the IGY.

It has produced a merged internally consistent data set of open ocean subsurface measurements for biogeochemical investigations, in particular, studies involving the carbon system. The original focus area was the North Atlantic Ocean, but over time the geographic extent expanded and CARINA now includes data from the entire Atlantic, the Arctic Ocean, and the Southern Ocean. Carbon data from the Pacific Ocean are being synthesized in the PICES effort.

The CARINA database includes data from 188 cruises. The salinity, oxygen, nutrient, inorganic carbon system and CFC data have been subjected to extensive quality control and adjustments have been made when necessary. The internally consistent data are available as three data products, one each for the Arctic Mediterranean Seas, the Atlantic and the Southern Oceans (CARINA Data Products). In addition, all of the individual cruise data files have been made available in WOCE exchange format in a single location (Cruise Summary Table) along with metadata and references. We strongly recommend users to employ the data products instead of the individual cruise files as the data in the latter have not been corrected for biases identified during the secondary QC. The CARINA effort is further described in the following as well as in the CARINA special issue of Earth System Science Data (ESSD) Journal.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">It is envisioned that the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008 will be an
intense, internationally coordinated campaign of research that will initiate a
new era in polar science. IPY 2007-2008 will include research in both polar
regions and recognise the strong links these regions have with the rest of the
globe. It will involve a wide range of research disciplines, including the
social sciences, but the emphasis will be interdisciplinary in its approach and
truly international in participation. It aims to educate and involve the
public, and to help train the next generation of engineers, scientists, and
leaders.

The International Council for Science (ICSU) formally agreed to establish an
International Polar Year in 2007-2008 and formed an International Planning
Group to direct the development of an IPY programme. The World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) agreed to co-sponsor the Polar Year with ICSU and
contributed to the Planning Group activities in 2003-2004. In September 2004
the Planning Group completed its brief and handed over leadership of the Polar
Year planning to the ICSU-WMO Joint Committee.

NACP Project Profile http://www.nacarbon.org/cgi-nacp/web/investigations/inv_pgp.pl?pgid=202

We propose to estimate carbon fluxes from the North American continent taking into account 30 years of climate and disturbance history. Our approach is to utilize the forest age and biomass results based on time series Landsat and FIA data developed by a currently funded NASA Carbon Cycle Science Project (North American Forest Disturbance and Regrowth Since 1972, PI: S. N. Goward). Dense time series data for a number of forested scenes (&gt;25) in the US and Canada will be used to initialize and calibrate a biogeochemical model that predicts gross and net carbon fluxes. Model testing will include appropriate Ameriflux, LTER, NACP Tier 2, and FIA data. Climate variability (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) will also be included in the analysis. Then using less temporally dense satellite data but wall to wall continental coverage, the modeling will predict gross and net carbon fluxes resulting from disturbance history and climate for the forests of North America. The products of this study will be used by our collaborators as boundary conditions for atmospheric transport (forward and inversion) models. By reconciling top-down (atmosphere) and bottom-up (biogeochemistry) analyses of the net fluxes we will be able to estimate accuracy and uncertainty in our model results.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: ECONOR
Proposal URL:http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=355

The project builds on two prior activities. 

First, the ArcStat project has performed a very important service in setting up a data base system for economic activity in the Arctic (University Laval, Quebec, Gerard) . That activity has a history and a purpose of its own, valid and valuable independently of the proposed IPY activity, but will prove additionally valuable as a basis for the proposed activity. 

Second, the ECONOR project, funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nordic Council of Ministers, has seven participating institutions throughout the Arctic (see list, concluding section). The project has built a network and started documentation and analysis of the importance of the Arctic to the rest of the world. Using the network through workshops and collection of data and analysis, the project focuses on trade and other economic flows between the Arctic regions and the rest of the world. Briefly, the draft report concludes: i) the Arctic is important to the rest of the world as a resource provider through trade flows, not only because of its unique natural habitats and the livelihoods of the people living there; ii) climate change may raise the value of certain resources to the rest of the world (increased growth, reduced costs), while reducing the value of others; iii) increased access, due to receding sea ice, will not only increase the value of important resources, but also put stress on existing control regimes, including geopolitically through maritime transport and military presence. 

Proposed activities in the ECONOR II project are as follows:

a) The value of Arctic natural resources. The value of natural resources (oil, gas and other mineral resources, fish, forests, tourism) will here be estimated based on an optimal control regime, i.e. assuming that challenges such as over fishing, stalemate and conflict will somehow be handled adequately. Environmental stresses will be among the important management challenges in this critically vulnerable area. 
b) Sovereign control and access to resources in the Arctic. This activity builds on existing boundaries of sovereign control, and asks what important coordination requirements there are between countries in order for resources and activities to be managed sensibly in an era when both access to and pressure on arctic resources will be increasing. The activity comprises analysis of political economy, but limited to the perspective of interests between countries. 
c) The political economy of natural resources development in the Arctic. This project applies concepts from the literature on decentralization, to analyze how institutions within each country influences both how resources are developed and how the rent is distributed. Is it the case, for instance, that delegation of decision-making power to an Arctic region, or to indigenous people (or both) will influence how the resources are developed, employment consequences in the Arctic, and how beneficial resource developments will be? 

For all the three activities, there is a required minimum level of participation from the network institutions, and this comprises data provision and descriptive analysis. As an example of how this goes beyond data on resources and activity levels, information is required on how decision making is delegated to Arctic sub-national entities in the federal countries (USA, Canada, Russia) and in the unitary countries (Norway, Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands, Sweden, Finland). On this basis, specialized activities will be built, as funding allows.

Global warming will have a large impact on glaciers in the Arctic region. Changes in the extent of glaciers will effect sea level, and may lead to substantial changes in sediment and fresh water supplies to embayments and fjords. 

In ACIA, a simple approach was taken to estimate the runoff of all glaciers in the Arctic for a set of climate-change scenarios. Changes in the surface mass balance were calculated without dealing with the fact that glacier geometries will change. It was also assumed that the rate of iceberg production at calving fronts would not change. 

To arrive at more accurate predictions, we propose an internationally-coordinated effort to study the dynamics of Arctic glaciers and develop new tools to deal with this dynamic response. The key elements of this effort are 

(i) to make better use of observational techniques to assess the detailed dynamics of a key set of glaciers, and 
(ii) to develop models that can be used to aggregrate data and that are sufficiently robust to have predictive power. 

A set of target glaciers have been identified for intensive observations (in situ and from space) for the period 2007-2010. This set covers a wide range of climatic/geographical settings and takes maximum advantage of prior long-term studies. 

The target glaciers are:
- Academy of Sciences Ice Cap (Severnaya Zemlya)
- Glacier No. 1 (Hall Island, Franz Josef Land)
- Austfonna (Svalbard)
- Hansbreen (Svalbard)
- Kronebreen (Svalbard)
- Kongsvegen (Svalbard)
- North Scandinavia transect (Langfjordjøkelen, Storglaciären, Marmaglaciären)
- Vatnajökull (Iceland)
- Kangerlussuaq basin (West Greenland)
- Devon Ice Cap (Canada)
- McCall Glacier (Alaska)
- Hubbard Glacier (Alaska)
- Columbia Glacier (Alaska)

Among the target glaciers are glaciers for which information is available on length/area in historical times [reports, drawings, photographs, old maps, etc.]. This information will be combined with the newly derived maps to reconstruct glacier evolution from the Little Ice Age into the present. This will provide a better perspective for projecting changes in the coming century.

Special attention will be given to tidewater glaciers. We want to look carefully at the interaction between surface processes and dynamics (e.g. the influence of meltwater supply on ice velocities and consequently calving rates; interactions between terminal moraines, sediment flux, and ice velocities). In a warming world some glaciers will transform from cold to polythermal, or from polythermal to temperate. We want to study the effect of such transitions on glacier dynamics and related rates of retreat. Another important aspect of study is the surface albedo. Poor drainage of meltwater may lead to more extensive zones of soaked snow and supraglacial lakes (as seen in large parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet), thus enlarging the sensitivity of ablation rates to warming.

Model development will be conducted in parallel with the observational programmes. The modelling work will deal with processes acting on the smaller scale (e.g. parameterization of the calving process) and on the larger scale (e.g. global dynamics of tidewater glaciers, response to climate change, interaction with sediment dynamics).

The PPS Arctic is a multidisciplinary research cluster composed of 9 EOI's, (cf. 1.6 &amp; 3.11) jointly seeking to explore 
current processes, past changes and spatiotemporal variability of biotic, abiotic, and socio-environmental conditions and 
resource components along and across the transition zone between arctic and boreal regions. This zone, the tundra-taiga ecotone 
varies dramatically in width (up to hundreds of kilometres) throughout the circum-arctic North and has thus a recognized exceptional
importance, in terms of global vegetation, climate, biodiversity and human settlement. Further, the particular vulnerability of 
the zone to changes in climate and land use is recognized, along with concern for subsequent alterations and shifts of its position
with consequences for the entire arctic region through feedback mechanisms. Despite this recognition, comprehensive and large 
scale multidisciplinary scientific focus incorporating cause, effect, and importance of its past and present transformation to 
the biota and human societies, has been lacking. The PPS Arctic is composed of four scientific modules (cf. 3.2). The unifying 
foci among the modules are defined by: SPACE The transitional zone between the boreal forest and the open treeless tundra; TIME 
The Holocene, the present and the next 100 years; SCOPE Interdisciplinary research, monitoring change, and sustainable resource use. 
The main aim is to obtain an understanding of: i) The controls on the location and pattern of the zone; ii) The effect of global 
change on the location of the zone; iii) The feedback effect of the character and location of the zone on the global climate. 
Implicit in these three items is consideration of the role of human societies inside and near the transition zone. This refers 
both to the responses of human communities to changes in the zone and to their impact on the ecotone. The PPS Arctic cluster 
provides a framework for a coordinated and integrated scientific effort to understand the dynamics of the arctic-boreal transition 
zone, and ensures that results can be used in multiple contexts including informed decision making by the public and policy makers. 
Specific objectives are: To develop effective techniques and carry out quantitative spatial and temporal analysis of the location 
of transitional ecosystems within the circumpolar arctic-boreal transition zone; To understand ecosystem and geosystem controls 
and responses in different compartments of the zone, both resilient and sensitive; To build realistic models of transition zone 
dynamics; To validate the models by ground level observations, dependent on scale and land use history; To use them to implement 
a program of ecosystem, geosystem, and landscape analysis, examining the effects of global and local change on species, communities, 
and ecosystems; To assess the socio-economic impacts of potential future changes in the transitional zones, incorporating results 
into an expert information system, which will be utilized for estimating climate change responses, sustainable ecosystem management 
and landscape planning in support of policy decisions; To exchange methods on climate change monitoring, sustainable land use 
strategy and science/policy issues, and use them as a tool in forecasting ecosystem changes and options for mitigation. 
To realize the main aim and specific objectives PPS Arctic focuses on a set of unifying themes: terminology, location, history 
of shifts, interface processes, model realism, effects of shifts, detecting shifts, and human societies and shifts. A range of 
tasks will be pursued, linked to these themes: Standardize terminology; Determine current location and characteristics using 
remote sensing data, aerial photographs, geographical information systems and field campaigns, as well as using local and indigenous 
knowledge; Study the history of tree distribution patterns more comprehensively using multiple techniques such as tree-ring analysis, 
macrofossil, stomata and pollen analyses coupled with molecular genetics; Study environmental conditions across the zone by using, 
for example, meteorological, geomorphological, hydrological, and permafrost measurements; Study population dynamics, population ecology, 
developmental phenology, and physiological ecology of present tundra-taiga species; Study the effect of tree cover on ecosystem ecology 
including greenhouse gas fluxes and energy balance across the boreal-arctic interface (feedback effects); Study the nature and effect 
of present and past disturbances such as fires, insect outbreaks and human activities on the nature and location of the zone and its 
sustainable use; Study socio-economic and ecosystem management conditions across the zone, which includes assessment of human impacts 
on the nature and location of the zone and consequences for human activities and strategies for sustainable development; Build-process 
based models and predictions for the effects of environmental change, with a greater degree of realism than current models; Conduct 
scientific manipulation experiments and analyze data from large-scale human activities such as engineering and forestry projects to 
test the models.

The sea ice cover plays an important role in the global climate system, both as an indicator and an amplifier of environmental change. It is important to continue and expand long-term observations of these changes to improve the fundamental understanding of the role of the sea ice cover in the global climate system and its utility as a climate change indicator. This formidable task spans an extensive range of temporal and spatial scales. An integrated, coordinated, and interdisciplinary approach will be used to monitor the state of the Arctic sea ice cover and investigate its governing processes. There are numerous tools that will be brought to bear on this task, including satellite remote sensing, autonomous rovers, buoys, ocean moorings, field campaigns and numerical models. Satellite remote sensing provides large-scale descriptions of such basic parameters as ice distribution, melt zone, ice motion, and cloud fraction at intervals of half a day to a week. Buoys and moorings will contribute high temporal resolution and can measure parameters currently unavailable from space such as atmospheric fluxes, ice thickness, internal ice temperature, photographs of surface conditions, and ocean temperature and salinity. The fixed observing systems will be complemented by autonomous mobile platforms including aerial vehicles, underwater vehicles, and land vehicles. A coordinated array of such vehicles, with integrated sensor systems, will provide spatial and temporal coverage that has previously been unavailable. Field campaigns will be used to explore, in detail, the state of the ice cover and the processes that govern the ice cover. The campaigns will be pan-Arctic including areas that have been largely unexamined, such as the region north of Greenland. Process studies will examine the interactions of the lower atmosphere, ice surface, and upper ocean that are crucial for understanding and modeling the the pack ice mass balance. Special attention will be paid to the impact of the hetereogeneity of the snow and ice on thermodynamic and dynamic processes. New techniques will be employed, such as isotope analysis of sea ice samples for information on surface water mass changes. Numerical models will be used to assess the character of the changes in the ice cover and predict their impacts on the rest of the climate system. Models will also assist in planning the observation program. The synthesis of the observations and models will provide a comprehensive picture of Arctic change. The seasonal ice zone (SIZ), which is predicted to extend over most of the Arctic Ocean by mid-century, is of particular interest. Given the challenges of operating in the SIZ environment, data for this component of the cryosphere are lacking, making it impossible to effectively predict the consequences of this dramatic change. We plan to obtain a comprehensive data set of key biophysical variables describing the evolution and state of the seasonal ice zone. The activities will examine the role of the snow cover in atmosphere-ice-ocean interaction, shifting patterns of spatio-temporal variability in sub-Arctic and Arctic seas, the important role of ice-associated biological communities in Arctic ecosystems, and latitudinal and bi-polar contrasts in atmosphere-ice-ocean interaction and biodiversity. Recent sea ice ecosystem changes will be assessed and potential future changes and their consequent impacts on higher trophic levels will be estimated. The International Polar Year will be an extraordinary opportunity to capture the imagination of students and the public. We will use this opportunity to convey not only information about the Arctic sea ice cover and its role in global climate, but also an understanding and an appreciation of science in general. We propose an extensive educational outreach component that will include media contacts, web sites, public lectures, and K-12 classroom programs. Undergraduate and graduate students will be entrained in all aspects of the our work from the planning stage to the field observations and modeling. A two week long International Summer School on Sea Ice will be held at the University Centre in Svalbard to increase the knowledge of sea ice related geophysics among both students and scientists, faciliate interdisciplinary research, and stimulate international cooperation.

The Winter Icing and Storms Project is a multi-investigator
program to study the meteorological conditions that produce

supercooled liquid water in the storms. ETL's participation in
the Denver area field experiments from 1990 to 1994 included the
use of microwave radiometers to monitor the vertically-integrated
liquid water content of winter clouds and the NOAA/K and NOAA/C
radars to observe the clouds' fine-scale internal structure and
motions. A dual-wavelength technique for mapping the liquid water
regions of clouds was tested and radar polarization signatures of
water drops, and various ice crystal types were developed using
theoretical modeling and observations.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SageSTEP (Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project) is a regional experiment to evaluate methods of sagebrush steppe restoration in the Great Basin.

The sagebrush steppe land type occupies 100 million acres in the Western U.S. This land type is characterized by large, dry, open areas with few trees (steppe), and consists of plant communities dominated by sagebrush with a mixture of other shrubs and grasses in the understory. Healthy sagebrush steppe communities in the Great Basin are rapidly disappearing due to invasion of non-native plants (especially cheatgrass), catastrophic wildfires, and encroachment of pinyon-juniper woodlands. Sagebrush communities have been identified as one of the most threatened land types in North America, and as much as half of this land type has already been lost in the Great Basin. Many of the sagebrush communities that remain are in poor health (the sagebrush plants are old and unproductive and other native plants are scarce in the understory).

Funded by the Joint Fire Science Program, SageSTEP is a 5-year study that will explore ways to restore sagebrush communities. Land management options, including prescribed fire, mechanical thinning of shrubs and trees, and herbicide application will help land managers learn how to reduce the potential for wildfire and restore healthy and diverse native plant communities. The project is fully interdisciplinary, with ecological, economic, and social components. Results of this project will provide resource managers with improved information to make restoration management decisions with reduced risk and uncertainty.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The purpose of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) is to use the relationship that exists between current satellite measurements at the earth's surface, related particularly to vegetation cover, and to establish a 20-year homogeneous data set of quantities that characterize the state of the surface. Such a data set is required to increase our understanding of the interactions linking land-surface properties and the earth's climate.
      
The idea of the ISLSC Project has two roots in the World Climate Programme. First, the use of time series of satellite data to monitor seasonal and long-term variations in land use and vegetation cover, in order to assess quantitatively the changes in the structure of the surface which occur either by man's action or as an impact of climate variability. Second the inference from satellite imagery of quantities needed either to improve upon the parameterization of land-surface/atmosphere interactions in climate models, or to generate input parameters for climate models.
      
The ISLSC Project involves a series of sub-projects which concentrate on specific geographic locations. The first effort (Inter-Disciplinary Studies-Land Surface Climatology Project: IDS-LSCP) was designed to correlate historic satellite data with current satellite data and ground truth experiments in order to detect any long-term change in the land surface resulting from climate or human activities. The area of interest was in the southwest United States and in the Sonoran Desert of northern Mexico.

The second effort involved a field experiment (First ISLSCP FIELD EXPERIMENT: FIFE), which was designed to correlate existing satellite data and ground truth data in an effort to detect climate-related fluctuations or man-induced changes on the land surface. The FIFE site was located on the Konza Prairie in northeast Kansas. Another field experiment (Boral Ecosystem Atmosphere Study: BOREAS), using the same approach as in FIFE, is planned for two sites in the northern sections of the Canadian Provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

Data from the FIFE was originally archived with the NASA Pilot Land Data System (PLDS). In 1994, the FIFE data was transferred to the   Earth Observing System Data Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Data from the BOREAS will also be archived at ORNL DAAC as will other data from ISLSCP.

Aquarius is a focused satellite mission to measure global Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Scientific progress is limited because conventional in situ SSS sampling is too sparse to give the global view of salinity variability that only a satellite can provide.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The flow of nutrients into coastal waters from land-based sources has seen a worldwide increase over the last decades. The resulting change in water quality has many potential impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems. Phosphorus and nitrogen contribute to enhanced algae growth, and subsequent decomposition reduces oxygen availability to benthic sea creatures like fish, shell fish, and crustaceans. Changes to nutrient loadings can also change the phytoplankton species composition and diversity. In extreme cases, eutrophication can lead to hypoxia—oxygen-depleted “dead zones”—and harmful algal blooms.

Measuring chlorophyll concentrations as an indicator of algae biomass may provide one tool to assess coastal water quality and its change over time. Here, we used chlorophyll-a concentrations derived from NASA's Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) to analyze trends over a ten year period (1998–2007). We attempted to identify near-coastal areas with improving, declining, and stable chlorophyll concentrations that can provide guidance for decision making in the context of environmental management.

The Species at Risk Program (SAR) is sponsered by the United States
Geological Survey, Biological Resources Division. The program develops
scientific information on the status of sensitive species or groups of
species, particularly with respect to the relationship of species
abundance and distribution to habitat conditions and environmental
stresses. The basic purpose of SAR is to generate information that
allows the development of conservation agreements, action plans,
management alternatives, etc., to provide for the protection of
species and their habitats and thereby preclude the need for listing
species as threatened or endangered.

The initiative provides an opportunity for scientists to participate
through survey and research activities. Projects are specifically
intended to be of short duration and should seek to optimize
partnerships with federal agencies, states, universities, and the
private sector. Successful SAR projects are often conducted by
investigators who have identified key, small but critical gaps in
biological knowledge.

The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) was established by
ICSU: The International Council for Science in October 1958 to
continue the cooperative programs of rocket and satellite
research successfully undertaken during the International
Geophysical Year of 1957-1958. The ICSU resolution creating
COSPAR stated that the primary purpose of COSPAR would be to
"provide the world scientific community with the means whereby
it may exploit the possibilities of satellites and space probes
of all kinds for scientific purposes, and exchange the resulting
data on a cooperative basis."

COSPAR is an interdisciplinary scientific organization concerned
with international progress in all areas of scientific research
carried out with space vehicles, rockets, and balloons.

COSPAR's objectives are carried out by the international
community of scientists working through ICSU and its adhering
National Academies and International Scientific
Unions. Operating under the rules of ICSU, COSPAR ignores
political considerations and considers all questions solely from
the scientific viewpoint.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">The Arctic Hydrological Cycle Monitoring, Modelling and Assessment Program</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: Arctic-Hydra
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=104

The scientific goals of the Arctic-HYDRA project are: To characterize variability in the Arctic Hydrological Cycle (AHC) and to examine linkages between atmospheric forcing and continental discharge to the ocean; to assess the historical response of the Arctic Ocean to variations in freshwater input from rivers and net precipitation over the ocean; to attribute to specific elements of the AHC or to external forcing the sources of observed spatial-temporal variability in the land-ocean-ice-atmosphere system; to detect emerging changes in the contemporary state of the AHC in near real time and to place such changes into a broader historical context. 

Given the scope of these goals and the relatively short time-frame of the IPY, Arctic-HYDRA also forms part of the parallel longer term (10-15 yr) objectives of the ICARPII (International Conference on Arctic Research Planning) Working Group 7 (WG7) project "Terrestrial Cryospheric and Hydrologic Processes and Systems". 

The Arctic-HYDRA project consists of a core network for observation of the AHC (Arctic-HYCOS) coupled with a suite of intensive, focused process studies that are based on in-depth measurements and modelling of the individual components of the AHC. Furthermore, hydrological models and data assimilation techniques will be developed to generate a comprehensive, integrated description of the AHC including the feedbacks between the atmosphere, cryosphere and the oceans. The project will have a data management and information system in accordance with IPY and WMO protocol. It will establish links with other relevant clusters, e.g. on meteorology, climatology, cryosphere, including permafrost, snow-cover and glaciers, biosphere and societal issues affected by the AHC.

The Arctic-HYCOS is the core network of the Arctic-HYDRA. This system is intended to provide hydrological information of a high quality, both historical as well as near real time data. It will provide an important benchmark for understanding future change to the AHC; information essential to the longer term ICARPII-WG7 program. The system will be based on the existing national data bases and observation systems in the Arctic countries that have historical long-term observation series on the large rivers discharging to the Arctic Ocean, as well as stations on tributaries and smaller rivers. The Arctic-HYCOS network will meet the requirements of WMO-HYCOS. During the International Polar Year (IPY) four test hydrological stations are to be established in the Mackenzie (Canada), Lena and Pechora (Russia) and Tana (Norway, Finland) river basins. It is envisaged that additional sites will be established in accordance with the broader plan of the Arctic-HYCOS and ICARPII-WG7 program. 

To complement the core network, a set of Long Term Hydrological Observatories (LTHOs) will be established in Arctic North America and Eurasia. They will collect basic hydrologic data such as precipitation, stream flow, groundwater levels, etc. as well as meteorological and biogeochemical data. In Alaska a LTHO (the Kuparuk River) will serve as an international natural laboratory dedicated to understanding the dynamic interactions between hydrological, ecological and climatological processes. Another LTHO will be established in the Eurasian Continent with focus on the ocean/atmospheric interactions with the hydrological cycle, including radio-sonde observation, radar measurement, GPS and solid precipitation measurements. Similar LTHO or network of research basins will focus on advancing our understanding and description of land surface cryospheric processes in order to improve the predictive capacity of Arctic atmospheric, cryospheric and hydrological models at small to medium scales. This will include observations of snow accumulation, over-winter ablation processes, snowmelt, soil thermodynamics, infiltration and water redistribution in frozen and thawing soils and cold regions water balance components in non-frozen periods. Two additional LTHOs will focus on the impact of aerosols on the AHC with supplementary UAV measurements and enhanced surface observations. The LTHO observations will be used to improve atmospheric, hydrologic and cryospheric process representations and also to evaluate meso-scale representations in models and assess model performance and sensitivity in multi-criteria prediction. The LTHO network will form the platform for developing the "supersites" of monitoring and research activities identified for the ICARPII-program.

The Arctic-Hydra executes a strategy for synthesis and integration studies of the AHC based on the Arctic-RIMS project. It will produce time-varying aerological and land surface water budgets including river and ice melt inputs to the Arctic Ocean. All key elements of the terrestrial and ocean water balance will be provided, including an assessment of potential error. A guiding philosophy of the proposed research is to "stay close to the data" although both data assimilation and modelling systems will be used for generalizations. The use of observations, either by themselves or as model drivers, provides a "reality-based" framework to understand observed variability and change in the Arctic system.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The CITE missions focused on testing and evaluating the ability
of instrumentation to measure key tropospheric constituents. The
methodology has been the intercomparison of airborne
measurements obtained for the same species by instruments
utilizing fundamentally different detection principles. These
missions provide the instrumentation techniques being employed
during the ABLE (Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiments)
missions.

The CITE-2 project was conducted aboard the NASA Electra
aircraft over California and the eastern Pacific Ocean in Summer
1986.  It compared instruments that measured components of the
nitrogen oxide photochemical cycle, which strongly influences
ozone and OH concentrations in the troposphere.  CITE-2 obtained
new scientific data on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric acid
(HNO3), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) within both clean
(Pacific) and polluted (continental) air.  Ancillary instruments
recorded abundances of other tropospheric chemical species to
test models of tropospheric photochemistry.

SCICEX is a 5 year program (1995-1999) in which the Navy has made
available a Sturgeon-class, nuclear powered, attack submarine for
unclassified science cruises to the Arctic Ocean. Beginning with a
test cruise in 1993, civilian scientists together with Navy personnel
have collected a variety of information on the geology, physics,
chemistry and biology of this critical region. The unmatched mobility
of submarines in ice covered oceans has allowed data to be collected
from over 100,000 miles of shiptrack in the Arctic providing samples
from some regions that have never before been visited.
(adaopted from the SCICEX Program Page)

The following submaries have been used in SCICEX:

- SCICEX/93 USS Pargo
- SCICEX/95 USS Cavalla
- SCICEX/96 USS Pogy
- SCICEX/97 USS Archerfish
- SCICEX/98 USS Hawkbill
- SCICEX/99 USS Hawkbill

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) is a satellite instrument for measuring ozone values. Of the five TOMS instruments which were built, four entered successful orbit. Nimbus-7 and Meteor-3 provided global measurements of total column ozone on a daily basis and together provide a complete data set of daily ozone from November 1978 - December 1994. After an eighteen month period when the program had no on-orbit capability, ADEOS TOMS was launched on August 17, 1996 and provided data until the satellite which housed it lost power on June 29, 1997. Earth Probe TOMS was launched on July 2, 1996 to provide supplemental measurements, but was boosted to a higher orbit to replace the failed ADEOS. The only total failure in the series was QuikTOMS, which was launched on September 21, 2001 but did not achieve an orbit. The transmitter for the Earth Probe TOMS failed on December 2, 2006.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Sea Ice Knowledge and Use Assessing Arctic Environmental and Social Change</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=166

Sea ice is a fundamental feature of the polar environment; it is also one of its most tangible indicators of change. During the last two decades, and in the past several years in particular, both polar scientists and local indigenous residents have detected dramatic shifts in the extent, timing, and other key parameters of Arctic sea ice. Whereas earlier IPY ventures contributed greatly to the progress in the scientific knowledge and understanding of polar sea ice, IPY 2007-2008 will become a milestone in the documentation of indigenous knowledge of sea ice environment. It will also set new standards for efforts and methods to bridge scientific and local observations of change in the ice-dominated northern ecosystems.

To achieve this we propose a coordinated international study of local knowledge and use of sea ice in several indigenous communities across the Arctic region. The acronym for our project's title, Sea Ice Knowledge and Use is also the most general word for sea ice in all Inuit (Eskimo) languages from Bering Strait to Greenland. For many Arctic indigenous peoples, despite rapid and pronounced changes in lifestyles and local cultures the ice-covered sea continues to be an integral component of daily life. It remains the most productive and widely used habitat for six to nine months every year. It is also the main platform for traveling; for observing weather systems, tidal and current cycles, marine mammals and other biota; as well as for training and education in navigational and subsistence skills passed from elders to younger hunters. Further, the status of local use and knowledge of sea ice is also an indicator of social change, a function of new technologies, economic and dietary trends, and of shifts in educational practices and cultural values. For many polar communities the use and knowledge of the ice-covered sea remains the key pillar of identity and resilience. It is their most prized intellectual treasure, the best of their scholarship based upon generations of experience and achievements. For scientists it offers an invaluable vision on how changes in polar ecosystems can be thoroughly documented and internalized through another form of knowledge and observations.

Our effort will include seasonal (long-term) monitoring and extensive documentation of the current status of local sea ice expertise and daily use; knowledge of ice features, hunting and traveling methods; safety rules; patterns of knowledge transmission and hunters' training in several (15 to 20) northern communities. Special focus will be placed upon the documentation of indigenous interpretations of current sea ice characteristics and environmental variability, cultural and ecological responses to increase resilience and community sustainability in times of change. Data will be collected via participant observations, interviews, and recording by local experts to illustrate: i) a seasonal sea ice topology; ii) the extent and areas of use by local people; iii) sea ice hazards; iv) key harvesting areas; v) traditional and current ice routes; vi) place names associated with ice features; vii) shifts in patterns of ice use due to social and/or environmental change; viii) recent and historical changes in subsistence and other societal strategies, due to environmental and socio-economic dynamics.
This body of data, supplied by maps, video, photographs, diaries of local observers, dictionaries of sea ice terms and place-names in local languages, along with other forms of records, such as narratives, memoirs, and oral histories, will create the first-ever broad dataset on indigenous knowledge and use of Arctic sea ice as of 2007-2008. Based upon cumulative observations by scientists and indigenous experts, this dataset will offer insight into both the past as well as the current conditions. The 2007-2008 dataset will thus be an invaluable baseline to any prospective comparison to detect future evidence of change, both environmental and social, for years to come and up to IPY-5 in 2057-2058. Another crucial task is to track sea ice changes over the last fifty years, and possibly longer, so that the scope and direction of change can be analyzed over a broader period of time. To achieve this the SIKU project teams will incorporate several senior researchers (science elders') and/or their field data of some 35-50 years ago, including those who had conducted their research in the years of IGY in 1957-1958, and after. This is aimed at matching past observations with the data of today's scholars working in the same communities. In a similar way, indigenous elders and experts are to work closely with hunters and community researchers of younger generations. Historical photographs, researchers' field notes, archival documents, and oral histories will be used extensively, to test the scope of change in ice, knowledge, and subsistence against observations of indigenous and scholarly experts from several generations.

The study will be undertaken as a network of regional projects led by teams from seven nations and focused on selected sites (communities) or areas (see 2.3). Each team will be multi-generational and will include a senior researcher ("elder") and younger scholars or students as well as local collaborators from various age groups. The project will be organized as a multidisciplinary study, in order to test ice records against the data on terrestrial and marine environments, hunting statistics, and weather patterns. Project personnel will include geographers, anthropologists, ice scholars, marine and terrestrial biologists, hunters, village elders, and subsistence specialists from local agencies.
The project will be conducted in partnership with indigenous institutions and communities. Participation and data sharing agreements will be sought with local village councils and hunters' associations as well as regional umbrella organizations (like Inuit Circumpolar Conference-Greenland, Alaskan Eskimo Walrus Commission, and others). Data will be collected, processed, and copied for prospective storage at regional archives, data-centers, and educational institutions. Photographs and records will be shared with local communities and families. The project's scientific products will be presented in team reports, co-authored papers, datasets deposited to the IPY data-management centers (see 3.6), individual/team monographs, and a final project volume of several chapters, organized by major geographic regions.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Marginal Ice Zone Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
Marginal Ice Zone Experiment (MIZEX) was an multi-national project
that actually began in the summer of 1983.  It was the most extensive
research project ever undertaken to study the ice, water and air
conditions in the arctic sea between Svalbard and Greenland.  The
project which eventually had over 100 researchers, was headed by
Norwegian Oceanographer Ola M. Johannessen.

The drift ice that forms between Greenland and Svalbard, which forms
an almost continuous sheet, had been a mystery for many years and
always presented challenges to Arctic researchers.  They sought to
seek the infulence of the huge air masses on the weather systems of
the Northern hemisphere.

MIZEX gained the scientists valuable information on the way ice is
affected by winds, current, waves and movement.  Tests were done on
the thickness and toughness of the ice, as well as experiments to show
what happens when the drift ice comes up against the warmer waters of
the Atlantic Ocean.

On its first year of the expedition, it was predicted to spend nearly
&amp;#364 million (U.S.), an amount which was to be expanded to
&amp;#368 million by 1984.  Ice measurements were to be taken up until
1990, where in the latter stages of the project, satellite photographs
were to be taken of the ice pack.  While the project was ongoing, four
remote-analysis aircraft measured the movements of the ice in specific
areas; transmitting the data to the telemetry station at Troms?, which
transmitted the data back to the researchers on the ice.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The radiation budget represents the balance between incoming energy
from the Sun and outgoing thermal (longwave) and reflected (shortwave)
energy from the Earth. In the 1970's, NASA recognized the importance
of improving our understanding of the radiation budget and its effects
on the Earth's climate. Langley Research Center was charged with
developing a new generation of instrumentation to make accurate
regional and global measurements of the components of the radiation
budget. The Goddard Space Flight Center built the Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS) on which the first Earth Radiation Budget
Experiment (ERBE) instruments were launched by the Space Shuttle
Challenger in 1984. ERBE instruments were also launched on two
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather monitoring
satellites, NOAA 9 and NOAA 10 in 1984 and 1986.

An international team of scientists was selected from proposals to an
Announcement of Opportunity in 1978 to participate in the design and
development of ERBE. Dr Bruce Barkstrom, of the Radiation Sciences
Branch of Langley's Atmospheric Sciences Competency, was selected as
the ERBE Principal Investigator. He led the team through 30 meetings
to guide the development of the instrumentation and the ground
processing software for analyzing the data.

The ERBE Data Management Team was formed to design and develop the
ground data processing system based on algorithms from the Science
Team. Jim Kibler, Head of the Data Management Office in Langley's
Atmospheric Sciences Competency, led the team through three iterative
releases of the system to be ready for processing at the first launch.

By using state-of-the-art technology, the HAMSTRAD-Tropo radiometer uses spectral information in the domains 51-59 GHz (oxygen line) and 169-197 GHz (water vapor line) to derive accurate tropospheric profiles of temperature (with accuracy ranging from 1 to 2 K) and low absolute humidity (with accuracy ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 g ?? m-3), together with integrated water vapor (with accuracy of about 0.008 kg ?? m-2) and liquid water path. Prior to its installation at Dome C in January 2009, the fully automated radiometer has been deployed at the Pic du Midi (PdM, 42??56'N, 0??08'E, 2877 m asml, France) in February 2008 and was in operation for five months. Preliminary comparisons with radio soundings particularly launched in the vicinity of PdM in February 2008 and the outputs from the mesoscale MESO-NH model show a great consistency to within 0.2-0.3 g ?? m-3 between all absolute humidity data sets whatever the atmosphere considered (extremely dry or wet).

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Concordia, a new French-Italian facility for international and long-term scientific activities on the Antarctic Plateau</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">While there is an increasing awareness of the importance of Antarctic research, the 14 million km² Antarctic continent still only houses two permanent inland research stations, Amundsen-Scott and Vostok. Recognizing the unique research opportunities offered by the Antarctic Plateau, the French and Italian Antarctic program agreed in 1993 to cooperate in developing a permanent research support facility at Dome C. The new station, named “Concordia” (75°06’ S -123°23’ E), will be opened for wintering in 2005. However, the two first years will be mainly dedicated to the achievement of the buildings, tests of safety protocols and settlement of some scientific equipment. For this reason, Concordia is expected to be fully operational when the International Polar Year starts, in 2007. Dome C has several valuable characteristics that support the installation of a permanent scientific station: A substantial layer of ice, about 3,300m thick, offers great potential for climatic reconstruction. Ice cores were collected by the EPICA program, a European project involving 10 countries, and more than 900,000 years of climatic records are expected from these samples. In addition, numerous small lakes have been detected in vicinity of Concordia, giving opportunities for exploration and tests of new technologies for the exploration sub-glacial environment. The area corresponds almost to the centre of the polar vortex, a major component of the Antarctic Oscillation driving the heat and mass exchanges between the Antarctic continent and the surrounding ocean-sea-ice-atmosphere coupled system. This area is also suitable for studying the ozone depletion and the subsequent cooling of the stratosphere in spring. The Concordia station is a vantage central Antarctic site to analyze polar meteorological high-resolution data and to evaluate the performance of satellite instruments in terms of local and large scale circulation, surface meteorology and processes, boundary layer and free atmosphere meteorological profiles… The Antarctic Plateau is a well recognised, favourable site for astronomic observations due to its geographic location and its extremely dry, cold, rarefied and stable atmosphere. Millimetric/microwave polarimeters can exploit their high sensitivity in Dome-C, rivalling with space based instruments in selected sky areas. Dome-C is the only built location on the Earth where the 200 micron window is usable; the extremely low atmospheric emissivity will also allow optimal use of the other mm/sub-mm atmospheric windows for Galactic, Extragalactic and Cosmological studies. Dome C is a particularly promising location, at critical distance from highly active seismic regions to allow optimal sampling of the deep mantle and the core in crucial geometries. Besides, it is situated on the East Antarctic plateau about 1,000 km away from the coast in a site potentially very quiet and therefore ideal for seismographic observations. Dome C, at 3,233m above the continental crust, is protected from any magnetic perturbations by earth crust anomalies and is an ideal place for studying magnetism. Concordia is also a unique place to study the Earth-Solar relations within the particular polar cap region, and to understand their symmetrical and asymmetrical properties with respect to the Northern hemisphere Dome C is as a very isolated site with severe climatic conditions. It will be an excellent site for evaluating techniques and procedures for future work on other planets. It is also an excellent site for studying small groups of people in conditions close to those encountered in space vehicles or orbital stations. So, Concordia Station will be a new earth observatory and a logistic centre permitting the exploration of the East Antarctic plateau and giving opportunities to deploy new technical challenges and international projects.

The NOAA/NASA Pathfinder Program was initiated in 1990 in response to
a need for improved, long time series data sets for global change
research.  Candidate data sets were identified based on available
coverage and importance of the data in global change research.  All
Pathfinder data sets involve space-based observations.  Pathfinder
activities include reprocessing of these data using
community-consensus algorithms as recommended by designated Science
Working Groups (SWGs).  The data sets will be made available through
the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) of the Earth Observing
System Data Information System (EOSDIS).
Four data sets were identified for the initial Pathfinder processing effort:
- The Advanved Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from
NOAA/TIROS polar orbiting satellites.
- The TIROS Operation Vertical Sounder (TOVS) data from NOAA/TIROS polar
orbiting satellites.
- Data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
- The Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) from the Defense
Meteorological Satelitte Program (DMSP).
NASA, through the Mission to Planet Earth (MtPE) Program, initiated
the following Pathfinders:
- The Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) from the
Nimbus-7 satellite
- Selected time periods of Landsat data from land cover classification
and change detection of several periods and regions.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Arctic Freshwater Biodiversity Monitoring and Research Network</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (2004, 2005) concluded that predicted changes in climate and UV in the Arctic are expected to have far-reaching impacts on the hydrology and ecology of freshwater ecosystems. Key effects include changes in the distribution, abundance and ecology of aquatic species in various trophic levels, dramatic alterations in the physical environment that makes up their habitat, changes to the chemical properties of that environment, and alterations to the processes that act on and within freshwater ecosystems. Interactions of climatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation, with freshwater ecosystems are highly complex and hence can be propagated through ecosystems in ways that are often difficult to predict. This is partly because of our still relatively poor understanding of the structure and function of arctic freshwater systems and their basic inter-relationships with climate and other environmental variables, as well as by a paucity of long-term freshwater monitoring sites and integrated hydro-ecological research programs in the Arctic. Predictions of hydro-ecological impacts are further complicated by synergistic and cumulative effects.
The Arctic Council accepted the findings from the ACIA and directed two of its scientific working groups (Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) and Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)) to review the ACIA findings and develop follow-on programmes and activities to address the key knowledge gaps that were identified. One of the outcomes of this process by the CAFF working group was the implementation of the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring
Programme (CBMP) formally released in September, 2005 (http://www.caff.is). The CBMP calls for the development of a number of specific monitoring networks designed to quantify the status and trends of Arctic biota of primary importance to the ecological integrity of Arctic ecosystems and the culture and livelihood of indigenous peoples.
Building on existing regional and national aquatic biomonitoring and research programs in the Arctic, this proposal is concerned with the development and implemenation of a freshwater biodiversity monitoring and research network that focuses on obtaining a circumpolar perspective on the current and future status of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function. The network will focus on data collection, interpretation and dissemination on the status and trends of pelagic and benthic macroinvertebrates, phyoplankton and microbial communities/assemblages, and macrophytes) in representative lentic (lake, pond, wetlands) and lotic (river, stream) ecosystems.
Complementing the proposed Char Monitoring Network (Reist) and the overall CBMP framework (Raillard) , specific goals during the IPY period (2006-2008) will be to: 1) establish and formalize the circumpolar network through workshops, linkages and outreach to indigenous peoples, researchers, conservation groups, etc.; 2) prepare a state of aquatic ecosystem biodiversity report through collating and analyses of existing information; and, 3) establish relevant parameters for continued monitoring and assessment of aquatic biodiversity; 3) create a database of georeferenced and genetically barcoded specimens; and, 4) establish the network of long-term monitoring/research sites/teams in as many Arctic countries as possible. The IPY-related outcomes will be used as a foundation to secure long-term funding for the Network, establish legacy databases, and launch new approaches (e.g., genetic barcoding) and research topics suitable for long-term monitoring and research, as recommeded by ACIA. The scientific products of the network will be used to support decision-makers responsible for the management, conservation and protection of aquatic ecosystems and related biological resources in the Arctic.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Scotia Arc Research Project</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">[from "http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/scarp/scarp.htm"]

Antarctica is the Earth's most isolated continent. It is surrounded by
actively spreading ridges except in the South American sector. The
motion of South America with respect to Antarctica is latitudinal and
left-lateral at approximately 22 mm per year and is distributed along
the boundaries of the intervening Scotia plate. A prominent but
discontinuous bathymetric high known as the Scotia Ridge surrounds the
Scotia plate on three sides. This feature includes some continental
material detached from the South American and Antarctic continents,
but its eastern closure is a volcanically and seismically active group
of islands, the South Sandwich arc, that is separated from the Scotia
plate by a vigorously spreading back-arc ridge. The entire
east-closing, locally emergent bathymetric feature joining the two
continents, is known as the Scotia arc. The D-shaped Sandwich plate
and arc appear to be moving rapidly east with respect to both South
America and Antarctica, thereby for the first time introducing a
subduction system into the otherwise rift-bounded South Atlantic Ocean
basin. This motion may constitute the best evidence for mantle return
flow from the closing Pacific Ocean basin to the expanding Atlantic
Ocean basin. The Scotia arc is nonetheless one of the most poorly
constrained of the major tectonic systems on Earth, yet it is a
critical and enigmatic link in global plate-motion circuits.


Our proposed ScArc GPS Project (SCARP) will use the Global Positioning
System (GPS) to measure the plate motions between South America,
Antarctica and Africa, and around the Scotia arc using a newly
developed geodetic strategy known as a multimodal occupation strategy
(MOST). This involves setting up permanent GPS receivers at a small
number of sites in South America and Antarctica, and using additional
receivers to position numerous stations relative to this continuously
operating network. Two seasonally occupied stations in the South
Sandwich islands will be tied to permanent GPS sites in South America,
Antarctica and Africa, and to intervening stations in the Falkland,
South Georgia and South Orkney islands that will be occupied on an
occasional basis by British collaborators. During the initial three
years the South Sandwich arc motion will be easily resolved, and using
roving stations in the Antarctic Peninsula-South Shetland Islands
area, we should be able to determine if extension is occurring across
Bransfield Strait. We also propose to construct a relatively dense
subnetwork in Patagonia/Tierra del Fuego, and a moderately dense
subnetwork in the Antarctic Peninsula. While we do not expect to
achieve sub-millimeter/year velocity resolution in the initial three
year project with these subnetworks, this project will establish the
baseline necessary for a follow-on suite of measurements in perhaps
six to eight years. The follow-on project will allow us to
characterize the slow motions and deformations that occur across and
within the boundaries of the Scotia plate. The deformation at the
South Sandwich Trench and seafloor spreading behind the arc will be
investigated by marine geophysics while GPS measurements are be
undertaken on the islands.


The objectives of SCARP are to determine:

1. the relative motions of the Antarctic, South American, Scotia and
South Sandwich plates;

2. the rate of rollback of the South Sandwich Trench in a South
American-African framework;

3. strain partitioning within the South America-Scotia plate boundary
zone, Tierra del Fuego;

4. the rate of extension across the volcanically active Bransfield
trough and the present rate of uplift or subsidence of the extinct
South Shetland Islands volcanic arc.

These objectives in turn will allow us to:

1. Evaluate what the South Sandwich trench rollback tells us about
mantle flow and the potential for transforming a passive rifted ocean
basin into a subducting or disappearing ocean basin. This also
requires shipboard work that will allow us to investigate deformation
of the South American plate as it is subducted at the South Sandwich
trench;

2. Test for motion between East and West Antarctica postulated as a
source of error in global plate circuits

3. Determine why there is transpression along the northern boundary of
the Scotia plate and transtension along its southern boundary; and

4. Contribute to a geodetic assessment of the elastic displacement
field associated with extension in Bransfield Strait and the
accumulation or loss of ice on the Antarctic continent.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NEAREST is addressed to the identification and characterization of potential tsunami sources located near shore in the Gulf of Cadiz; the improvement of near-real time detection of signals by a multi parameter seafloor observatory for the characterization of potential tsunamigenic sources to be used in the development of an Early Warning System (EWS) Prototype; the improvement of integrated numerical models enabling more accurate scenarios of tsunami impact and the production of accurate maps in selected areas of the Algarve (SW Portugal), highly hit by the 1755 tsunamis. In this area, highly populated and prone to devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, excellent geological/geophysical knowledge has already been acquired in the last decade.

The methodological approach will be based on the cross-checking of multi parameter time series acquired on land by seismic and tide gauge stations on the seafloor and in the water column by broad band Ocean Bottom Seismometers and a multi parameter deep-sea platform, this latter equipped with real-time communication to an onshore warning centre. Land and sea data will be integrated to be used in a prototype of EWS.

NEAREST will search for sedimentological evidence of tsunamis records to improve the knowledge on the recurrence time for extreme events and will try to measure the key parameters for the comprehension of the tsunami generation mechanisms. The proposed method can be extended to other near-shore potential tsunamigenic sources, as for instance the Central Mediterranean (Western Ionian Sea), Aegean Arc and Marmara Sea.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The USGS Place-Based Studies (PBS) Program provides objective
integrated science for managers who are seeking to restore
natural functions and values of resources and the
environment. In order to restore these functions, managers must
have scientific information to resolve the complex resource
problems that are before them. Resource managers use scientific
information for several purposes. First, it helps to define the
extent of environmental problems, and to distinguish changes
caused by management actions from natural changes caused by
climatic shifts, environmental succession, and natural climatic
variability. Second, understanding how the ecosystem functions
helps managers formulate possible solutions to those
problems. Third, ecosystem models provide tools for determining
which proposed actions will be the most effective in resolving
the problems. Fourth, scientific information is necessary to
develop the criteria and strategy for monitoring the success of
management mod ifications.


Goals:

The goals of the PBS Program are (1) to provide relevant,
high-quality, impartial scientific information that permits
resource-management agencies to improve the scientific basis
for their decisions and to prevent or resolve
resource-management conflicts and (2) to facilitate integration
of scientific information.

The PBS Program integrates USGS research in specific, critical
ecosystems. At present the areas under study are the San
Francisco Bay/Delta, South Florida, the Chesapeake Bay, the
Platte River, the Greater Yellowstone area, the Mojave Desert,
and the Salton Sea. Funding has been requested to start studies
in the Great Lakes in FY 2000 .

The information is designed to have a direct, significant, and
immediate impact on management and policy decisions. Multi- and
inter-disciplinary approaches to environmental science are used
to address issues that involve environmental resources such as
water, minerals, biota, and land in specific critical
ecosystems in the United States.

Scientist are selected for their particular expertise from the
wide array of disciplines within the USGS, and apply their
diverse approaches to common problems. Studies in the present
suite of ecosystem areas include land characterization, surface
hydrologic and ecological modeling, geospatial database
management, ground- and surface-water hydrology, geophysics,
ecology, geochemistry, paleontology, and contaminant, sediment,
and nutrient dynamics. Scientists improve their interpretation
of data by working with related information from other
disciplines.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">On the basis of fossil plants and paleosols recorded in the sedimentary rocks of the Transantarctic Mountains, a model of Permian to Triassic climate at high paleolatitudes is emerging: After continental glaciers melted in the early Permian, forests grew in the cold, wet climate. By the early Triassic, warmer, drier conditions inhibited prolific plant growth. A moister, but still warm climate allowed plants to flourish later in the Triassic.

We will test and refine this model and investigate the effects of climate change on Permian to Triassic landscapes and ecosystems. Using exposures in the Allan Hills, we will search for, describe, and interpret fossil forests, vertebrate tracks and burrows, arthropod trackways, and subaqueously produced biogenic structures, and document the end of glaciation and the importance of major episodic sedimentation. In so doing, we will address broader questions that will contribute to understanding

the evolution of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and how they are affected by the end-Permian extinction,

the abundance and diversity of terrestrial and aquatic arthropods at high latitudes,

the paleogeographic distribution and evolution of vertebrates and invertebrates as recorded by trace and body fossils, and

the response of landscapes to changes in climate.

The excellent record preserved by this Permian to Triassic sequence provides a unique opportunity to compare high-latitude forests and freshwater and terrestrial faunas with better-known low-latitude equivalents during an important period of their evolution.

Jason-1 is the first follow-on to the highly successful TOPEX/Poseidon
mission that measured ocean surface topography to an accuracy of 4.2
cm, enabled scientists to forecast the 1997-1998 El Nino, and improved
understanding of ocean circulation and its effect of global
climate. The joint NASA-CNES program launched Jason-1 on December 7,
2002 from Vandenberg AFB, CA.  Like TOPEX/Poseidon, the payload
includes both American and French instruments. Jason-1 altimeter data
is part of a suite of data provided by other JPL-managed ocean
missions--the GRACE mission will use two satellites to accurately
measure Earth's mass distribution, and the QuikSCAT scatterometer
mission will measure ocean-surface winds.

From the moment the Jason-1 project began in September 1993 to the
official memorandum of understanding in December 1996 and the
satellite launch in December 2002, cooperation between CNES and NASA
has been the driving force behind its success. The two space agencies
have combined their expertise in satellite design and operation,
particularly for the ground segment-the nerve centre of the
mission. NASA has responsibility for satellite control and the
instruments it is supplying. To operate the satellite and process and
exploit data, CNES has developed the SSALTO multimission altimetry
centre. SSALTO also processes data from TOPEX/Poseidon and Envisat,
and controls and operates the Poseidon and DORIS instruments
(including DORIS on the Spot series of satellites). JPL also uses
SSALTO for Jason-1.

ACE is an international research initiative that has grown out of the ANTOSTRAT (ANTarctic Offshore STRATigraphy) project. ANTOSTRAT orginated in 1990 as an offshoot project of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Group of Specialists on the Evolution of Cenozoic Paleoenvironments of the Southern High Latitudes. The ANTOSTRAT program officially came to an end in July 2002. The goal of ACE is to continue the study of Antarctic climate and glacial history through paleoclimate and ice sheet modeling studies, purposefully integrated with geological investigations of the proxy record of ancient Antarctic climates and ice sheets. ACE is now an official SCAR program. A more complete introduction to ACE can be found at http://www.ace.scar.org//intro1.html

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: MODIL-NAO
Project URL: http://www.polaryear.no/prosjekter/Modilnao
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=46

MODIL-NAO is cooperation project of a scientific institute and an indigenous peoples' organisations. Cooperation will be on equal terms. Other scientific and monitoring institutions, both through IPY-related and other projects, cooperate as consultants. 

The project idea was initiated by the Association of Nenets People "Yasavey" of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO, Northwestern Russia), which has in their files documented a rather chaotic development of oil-related activities in the NAO; these activities have severe impacts on nature, reindeer pastures and the socio-economic situation of the indigenous people living in and of the land. Reindeer pastures have been and are continually destroyed and polluted. Numerous violations of Russian environmental law by oil companies seem to occur. To collect and make easily available data on this development, an Internet-based electronic GIS database and explanatory report showing these activities will be created.  Data monitoring will use personal observations of "Yasavey" members and other native representatives, questioning of native individuals in selected areas of the NAO, photo documentation, published data, inquiries at oil companies, satellite image surveying, etc. We also discuss cooperation with the Nenets Information and Analytical Center (NIAC) in the NAO.

The project is essentially a monitoring project. The GIS database will show the physical and ethno- geography (indigenous settlements and traditional land use areas) of the NAO, as well as all visible and detected impacts derived from hydrocarbon prospecting and production (drilling sites, pipelines, major vehicle track lines, damaged tundra areas, spills, etc.) as an interactive map to the scale of 1:1 mill. Details about the locations will be linked to the map in text and image format. The database will use technical solutions which have been successfully used for other topics at the Norwegian Polar Institute.
The accompanying report(s), to be prepared in print and on the Internet (in English and Russian), will discuss the observations in environmental, socio-economic, ethnic and human-security-related contexts. For this purpose, a working group consisting of indigenous representatives from the NAO and international experts on these topics will be formed. The discussion will incorporate experiences from similar activities in indigenous land use areas made in other parts of Russia and North America. Specialists from Canada and the Komi Republic have already indicated their interest in joining the project, while others are still to be addressed. 

Such a database can be used towards management and authorities as a documentation of illegal actions, and towards oil companies for negotiations on compensation claims. At the same time, the project will train Yasavey's staff in using GIS. The project can also function as a pilot project for other areas in the circumpolar North.

Dependent on available funding, the project can be carried out as a one-year's project, or a several years' project in order to monitor annual changes of the situation. The least desirable length would be two years, 2007 and 2008, which would provide an indication of the annual development.

Various atmospheric and oceanographic observations using Doppler radar, radiosonde, surface met monitor, CTD, ADCP, and so on will be carried out as a stationary observation at (0, 80.5E) about one month from the late October 2006, focusing on the vertical structure of water vapor, clouds, divergence field as well as diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature and surface flux. It is highly remarked that the combination with the buoy network deployed in this region is essential for this experiment, since it helps not only to study the heat budget but also to capture the long-term and wide-range atmospheric and oceanic features. In addition, as the MJO propagates eastward, zonal extension of the observational area is strongly desired. Thus, meteorological observations at Maldives Islands will also be conducted under the cooperation with the Maldives officials.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">TRACE-P is part of a long series of GTE aircraft missions aimed at better understanding of global tropospheric chemistry [McNeal et al., 1998]. Over the past two decades, GTE has conducted missions in several remote regions of the world (Amazonia, the Arctic, the tropical Atlantic, the Pacific) to characterize the natural processes determining the composition of the global troposphere and to assess the degree of human perturbation. The rapid industrialization now taking place in Asia is of compelling interest. Energy use in eastern Asia has increased by 5% yr-1 over the past decade and this rate of increase is expected to continue for the next two decades [U.S. Dept. of Energy, 1997]. Combustion of fossil fuels is the main source of energy. Emission of NOx in eastern Asia is expected to increase almost 5-fold from 1990 to 2020 [van Aardenne et al., 1999]. There is a unique opportunity to observe the time-dependent atmospheric impact of a major industrial revolution. Long-term observations of from ground sites and satellites can provide continuous monitoring of the temporal trend of atmospheric composition but are limited in terms of spatial coverage (ground sites) or the suite of species measurable (satellites). Aircraft missions can complement surface and satellite observations by providing a detailed investigation of the dynamical and chemical processes affecting atmospheric composition over broad geographical regions. .

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Cape Roberts Project: This joint venture brings together the
national antarctic programs and scientists from Australia, Germany,
Italy, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of
America. The aim is to recover and analyze cores from the sedimentary
strata beneath the sea floor off Cape Roberts, in the southwest corner
of the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Geologically the strata to be drilled are
located just within a major rift ^? the West Antarctic Rift System ^?
and have also been close to the South Pole for the last 130 million
years. They are over 1,500 meters (m) thick, and were laid down
between 30 and more than 100 million years ago.

Normally, strata from that long ago (Mid-Cretaceous to Paleogene) are
deeply buried, but strata from the sea floor off Cape Roberts record
old glacial and rifting events at or near the surface. Operations are
designed to recover a complete core representing the target 1,500 m of
strata; drilling for cores at three separate locations will accomplish
this, with the depth of individual excavations up to 700 m below the
sea floor. Curators cut the aggregate core into 1 m lengths, describe
them in geological detail, and then photograph them. Samples are then
distributed to researchers for a wide range of analyses ^? from
extracting specific target fossils to determining more precise age and
composition data for the sample.

The cores should help scientists answer two important questions:

Before the glaciations of the last 36 million years, were there ice
sheets on Antarctica that may have caused fluctuations in world-wide
sea levels?

How and when did the rifting of the Antarctic continent contribute to
the formation of the Transantarctic Mountains and the Ross Sea?

Developing scientific models to answer these questions should provide
more general insight into the etiology of changes in global sea level,
as well as the origins of mountains and basins.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Time Averaged Field Initiative (TAFI) is a collaborative multi-institutional project to improve the quality and spatial and temporal distribution of the 0-5 Ma paleomagnetic record from lava flows. The paleomagnetic laboratory at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography has primary responsibility for obtaining data from five locations around the globe: Spitzbergen, Idaho, Arizona, Costa Rica and Antarctica. We have now completed field work at all locations and directional analyses at the latter four. Paleointensity experiments are inherently more time consuming than directional analyses and yield data that are more difficult to interpret. Paleointensities are affected by many well known factors including differential cooling rates between the laboratory and the ancient TRMs, alteration, violation of the single domain assumptions, and so on. The key in data interpretation is to be able to tell good data from bad and has been much discussed throughout the history of paleomagnetism. We will present our paleointensity data for the last 5 million years and address issues of reliability criteria.

Clean Air Mapping ana Analysis Program(C-MAP) is an assessment
tool developed by the Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) to
better understand and characterize the effectiveness of
environmental programs such as the Acid Rain Program. The
primary goal behind the development of a GIS was to gain a
thorough understanding of the impacts of sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides emission reductions to the environment. The
decision to implement a GIS stemmed from a need to better
understand the implications of answers to policy questions
regarding acid rain control, and therefore to improve the
decision-making process. The extensive GIS database, available
for download, enables users to visually integrate various
emissions and effects data in map format, using their own GIS
software. Sample maps illustrating current trends and policy
issues of interest are displayed in the map gallery for viewing
and download.

GIS is helping in the assessment of whether current control
levels provide adequate protection of human health and the
environment. CAMD is using GIS to explore spatial patterns and
analyze regional trends in air quality, visibility, surface
water quality, acid deposition and forest health, as related to
emission levels:

1. Display and compare trends in environmental indicators (for
example, acid deposition, surface water chemistry, ambient air
concentrations) at national or regional scales.

2. Display such trends in environmental indicators overlaid with
trends in emissions.

3. Display trends at different annual time scales (for example
over 1-, 5-, or 10-year periods), or design annual vs. seasonal
comparisons.

4. Mark progress toward environmental goals

2.0 SUMMARY OF THE ACTIVITY

Rapid regional warming of air temperature on the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) observed over the last 50 yrs is exceptional and unprecedented within the past 500 yrs records of ice core data (Vaughan et al. 2001, Science 293). At Vernadsky Station (former Faraday, Beascochea Bay) aerial warming averages 0.56°C per decade since the 1950s (Turner et al. 2005, Int. J. Climatol. 25: 279-294). The glacial systems of the Antarctic Peninsula show direct responses to the climatic changes, including retreat of ice fronts and increased melt water production. The broad pattern of glacial retreat over time reflects the trend of atmospheric warming in the peninsula region since the 1940s: the magnitude of glacial retreat (average change in m a-1) increases towards the southern sectors (Cook et al. 2005, Science 308). It results that changes of terrestrial as well as marine ecosystems along the Peninsula are expected to be more subtle and graded in the North and more radical at the South-Western coasts of the WAP. A directly and plausibly relatable effect of glacial retreat along WAP is the opening of newly ice-free areas for the colonization of terrestrial and intertidal plant vegetation and animals. The ClicOPEN initiative is aimed at investigating the response of terrestrial and marine coastal systems to ongoing climate change in 4 areas of interest along the WAP. Comparative work can be carried out at Mac Murdo, Ross Sea, where climate change is far less (0.1°C/decade, Kejna &amp; Lagun, Polish Polar Studies, 2004).
Rationale of ClicOPEN: Locally increased import of fresh water from melting glaciers and increased sediment import from rock abrasion (by both, glacial melting and aerosol transport) are anticipated primary effects in coastal marine ecosystems. Warming and freshening of surface waters will impact shallow intertidal habitats. Freshening and shading induced changes of benthic and pelagic primary production and the alterations in the phytoplankton community composition are prone to alter quality and quantity of food supply for zooplankton, as well as for benthic filter and detritus feeders. This may entail important changes of trophic coupling in the coastal food webs. In the terrestrial sphere, an impact of glacial retreat and climate warming on the genetic diversity and evolutionary fitness of sessile lichens and bryophytes through range shifts and associated bottleneck effects is expected, and will be investigated using molecular markers. The climatic changes that propagate glacial melting on the WAP are prone also to impinge on Antarctic bottom communities and sediment composition in more remote areas of the Southern Ocean (e.g. South Georgia, South Orkneys, Weddell Sea). Loss of sea ice has been observed in several places beginning in the 1970s (Parkinson 2002). The reduction in sea ice correlates with a loss of krill stock density, likely to entail severe changes within coastal Antarctic food webs (Loeb et al. 1997, Nature 387, Atkinson et al. 2004, Nature 432). The ClicOPEN project aims to link the effects of glacial melting at the coast and the processes in key habitats at the shelf ice edge under focus in other EoIs like, CCAMLR (IPY 148), HABIPOL (IPY 543) and "Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML)". The objectives within the ClicOPEN approach are dual:
A) to analyze and quantify effects of glacial melting and increased rock erosion on terrestrial and near shore marine ecosystems on a latitudinal gradient along the Western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.
B) to provide a basis for a mechanistic understanding of climate change processes at the peninsula that will serve to draw a link to present and future changes in more remote shelf regions of the Southern Ocean.
ClicOPEN is land based and uses existing Antarctic research stations in 4 different areas of the Antarctic Peninsula as platforms for synoptic field and laboratory studies during the IPY. Comparative work at McMurdo, Ross Sea is intended. A station based programme enables us to include many scientists into cooperative and comparative work, make use of the existing logistic background provided by field stations and home institutions, and also to draw from historical data sets in locations of long-term scientific records, including temperature records and documented contours of ice caps and glaciers.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">THORPEX-IPY</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Improved numerical weather forecasting and climate simulations</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The WMO/WWRP’s THORPEX Global Research Programme involves nations from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Southern Hemisphere. THORPEX intends to conduct research that will accelerate improvements in the prediction and understanding of high-impact weather on the 1 to 14-day time-scale for the benefit of society, the environment and the economy.
The aims of this cluster proposal are to improve numerical weather prediction model systems and climate models by utilizing remotely sensed and in situ observations taken during the IPY and to study and advance our knowledge of meteorological, surface and ocean phenomena typical for the region. The investigations will also improve our understanding and modelling of polar-global interactions. The scope ranges from high-resolution numerical weather prediction to climate and regional ocean modelling. The motivation comes from several applications: 1) Regional weather forecasting: In polar areas there are strong needs for accurate weather forecasts. Further model-based ocean, ice and wave forecasting need accurate forcing fields. 2) Medium range (global) weather forecasting: Improved model quality in polar areas influences forecasts at mid and high latitudes. 3) Climate studies.
The project has four objectives:
The first is on forecasting and to what degree an improved use of satellite data and an optimized observational network, including targeted observations, will improve forecasts of high impact weather events (IPY project numbers 294; 394; 638; 600; 798; 811; 113; 146; 206, 410, 92, 888, contribution related to meteorology). These studies will not be limited to forecasting conditions over the poles, but will also address polar-global interactions. These investigations will provide insight into the design of the global observing system and into the potential impact of any IPY legacy measurement sites. New satellite technologies will be used to develop products that can potentially improve weather forecasts.
The second objective is to better understand physical and dynamic processes in the polar regions, in general, with a specific emphasis on aerosols, the microphysical properties of clouds and the possibility of improving parameterisation schemes of clouds and radiation for use in numerical weather prediction and climate models (294; 638; 600; 798; 70; 116; 158; 206; 410; 113, 297). The spatial variations in surface characteristics, stable lapse rates and extreme seasonal variations in solar radiation make the polar environment unique and a challenge for parameterizations.
The third objective is a deeper understanding of the polar regions through a focus on small scale weather phenomena and the impacts of topography and surface variations (394; 638; 618; 811; 113; 134; 146; 167; 297; 888, contribution related to meteorology). Such research will also provide valuable insight on the limitations of coarse-grid models, since recent research has provided evidence for a wide variety of circulations (terrain-induced vortices, downslope winds, flow channelling, thermodynamic impacts of open water etc) that are often sub-grid-scale in climate and many forecast models. This work includes investigations of the flow distortion over Greenland and how it impacts the mesoscale thermohaline circulation. In some cases the higher resolution modelling capability will remain in place as a legacy of THORPEX-IPY activities.
Taken together the research results from first three objectives the potential to improve future predictions of the weather and climate over the polar regions. Improvement in the initial state means an improved time series of operational and research analyses for climate change research.
The final objective is to utilize improved forecast systems to benefit society, economy and environment. High-impact weather events in polar regions include spring thaws, sea ice movement, and severe winter cyclones resulting in strong winds, high seas, and heavy precipitation as defined by their impact on public safety, fisheries and fishery management, activities of the indigenous arctic populations, wildlife, energy production and transportation. These problems are not local to the poles as the intrusion of polar air masses into higher latitudes also has dramatic impacts and many of the polar events are linked to wave trains that are initiated at lower latitudes. During IPY, the major operational forecast centers of the world will co-operate to form a THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) that will form the basis for research on ensemble prediction and on improving society’s ability to utilize forecast information. TIGGE will also be made available for IPY field operations.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A common type of device for wave-energy extraction is an oscillating water column (OWC) with a compression chamber. Peak performance of most OWC systems occurs at resonance with the driving waves. At resonance, oscillations increase linearly in time until damping inhibits further growth. Parametric resonance is introduced as a means of exciting the oscillations of the water column. In parametric resonance, oscillations increase exponentially in time. The use of this kind of resonance may increase the performance of OWC systems. This type of resonance occurs when one of the parameters in an oscillator varies periodically. Asymptotic methods are used to study the nonlinear dynamics of an OWC with parametric resonance. These results are compared with those of a numerical model of a real experimental laboratory setup.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This research initiative was formed with the objective to conduct long-term studies in the Southern Ocean (SO) which are associated with many global-climate changes issues. It is well known that the SO connects the major ocean basins permitting a global scale thermohaline circulation, therefore Antarctic bottom water formation and its variability as well as its pathways towards lower latitudes is a relevant information. Interocean connection is a route for heat and freshwater (climate) anomalies, as well as anthropogenic tracers. The SO also plays a major role in the global climate change due to its key role in the global geochemical cycle, particularly carbon. The proposed activities during the IPY (2007-2008) are related to the actual work which is actually carried out in the SO (lat&gt;30oS) by the Brazilian High Latitude Oceanography Group (GOAL), sponsored and funded by the Brazilian Antarctic Programme (PROANTAR). The main research topics of GOAL focuses in the understanding of (1) the formation and variability of dense bottom water close to the tip of Antarctic Peninsula; (2) the variability of Bransfield and Gerlache Straits ecosystems. (3) the role played by the SO in the global carbon cycle using in situ and satellite ocean color data; (4) the upper layer circulation and 3D structure eddies shedded by the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence. We also expect to undertake some transects, radiating outwards across the Antarctic tip continental shelf and slope, during austral summer period of January-March 2008, as a contribution to the project Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interactions (SASSI), planned by the iAnZone group for the IPY 2007-2008. Furthermore, we hope to participate in an international focused effort to make observations along the three SO chokepoints where the meridional spread of the SO dynamics is constrained and where the transport measurements and interocean exchanges can be accurately monitored. These actions are part of the more general strategy presented by the CLIVAR/CliC/SCAR Southern Ocean Implementation Panel.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Global Census of Marine Life on Seamounts</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A global study of seamount ecosystems, to determine their role in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity, and evolution of marine organisms, and to evaluate the effects of human exploitation.

Seamounts are ubiquitous features of the world's underwater topography and may play an important role in patterns of marine biogeography, potentially supporting high biodiversity and unique biological communities. Seamounts are often highly productive ecosystems, and may act as feeding grounds for fishes, marine mammals and seabirds. They are targeted for resource extraction such as fisheries and mining, but are ecologically vulnerable to such exploitation. At a global scale their biodiversity is poorly known with relatively few (&lt; 200 of an estimated 100 000) seamounts having been studied in any detail.

CenSeam commenced in 2005 and the CenSeam science community, with particular input from CenSeam's Data Analysis Working Group (DAWG), has defined two overarching priority themes (1) What factors drive community composition and diversity on seamounts, including any differences between seamounts and other habitat types? (2) What are the impacts of human activities on seamount community structure and function?

CenSeam has been working to coordinate existing and planned programs for maximum benefit, catalyze new seamount sampling activities, align research approaches and data collection where possible to ensure that opportunities for collaboration between programs are maximized, and integrate and analyze incoming information to create new knowledge. The program is working toward standardizing sampling methods (through the Standardisation Working Group, SWG) and data reporting (through the DAWG) wherever possible, to facilitate comparisons of biodiversity between areas.

CenSeam is helping to guide future sampling with a global perspective to fill critical knowledge gaps and target understudied regions and types of seamounts. In addition to fostering new expeditions, CenSeam is also consolidating and synthesizing existing data. OBIS is served by the open-access SeamountsOnline database (http://seamounts.sdsc.edu/), which is continually being expanded to include more physical and oceanographic data, and new data as they become available. This integrated seamount database is key to comprehensive synthesis and analysis of data as the program develops.

CenSeam's website is continually updated and CenSeam newsletters are regularly circulated (and can additionally be downloaded from the website; http://censeam.niwa.co.nz/censeam_news/newsletters). As well as serving the science community, the website targets students and members of the public with ship-to-shore logs and features on some of the weird and wonderful creatures found on seamounts (http://censeam.niwa.co.nz/outreach/censeam_creatures).

By the end of the Census in 2010, much will remain unknowable given the large number of seamounts, their widespread distribution, and large variability in physical characteristics and habitat type. But under CenSeam much progress will be made to improve our understanding of, and erect new paradigms about, seamount ecosystems.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: THORPEX-IPY
Project URL: http://www.ipy-thorpex.no/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=121

The WMO/WWRP's THORPEX Global Research Programme involves nations from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Southern Hemisphere. THORPEX intends to conduct research that will accelerate improvements in the prediction and understanding of high-impact weather on the 1 to 14-day time-scale for the benefit of society, the environment and the economy.

The aims of this cluster proposal are to improve numerical weather prediction model systems and climate models by utilizing remotely sensed and in situ observations taken during the IPY and to study and advance our knowledge of meteorological, surface and ocean phenomena typical for the region. The investigations will also improve our understanding and modelling of polar-global interactions. The scope ranges from high-resolution numerical weather prediction to climate and regional ocean modelling. The motivation comes from several applications: 1) Regional weather forecasting: In polar areas there are strong needs for accurate weather forecasts. Further model-based ocean, ice and wave forecasting need accurate forcing fields. 2) Medium range (global) weather forecasting: Improved model quality in polar areas influences forecasts at mid and high latitudes. 3) Climate studies.

The project has four objectives: 

The first is on forecasting and to what degree an improved use of satellite data and an optimized observational network, including targeted observations, will improve forecasts of high impact weather events (IPY project numbers 294; 394; 638; 600; 798; 811; 113; 146; 206, 410, 92, 888, contribution related to meteorology). These studies will not be limited to forecasting conditions over the poles, but will also address polar-global interactions. These investigations will provide insight into the design of the global observing system and into the potential impact of any IPY legacy measurement sites. New satellite technologies will be used to develop products that can potentially improve weather forecasts.

The second objective is to better understand physical and dynamic processes in the polar regions, in general, with a specific emphasis on aerosols, the microphysical properties of clouds and the possibility of improving parameterisation schemes of clouds and radiation for use in numerical weather prediction and climate models (294; 638; 600; 798; 70; 116; 158; 206; 410; 113, 297). The spatial variations in surface characteristics, stable lapse rates and extreme seasonal variations in solar radiation make the polar environment unique and a challenge for parameterizations. 

The third objective is a deeper understanding of the polar regions through a focus on small scale weather phenomena and the impacts of topography and surface variations (394; 638; 618; 811; 113; 134; 146; 167; 297; 888, contribution related to meteorology). Such research will also provide valuable insight on the limitations of coarse-grid models, since recent research has provided evidence for a wide variety of circulations (terrain-induced vortices, downslope winds, flow channelling, thermodynamic impacts of open water etc) that are often sub-grid-scale in climate and many forecast models. This work includes investigations of the flow distortion over Greenland and how it impacts the mesoscale thermohaline circulation. In some cases the higher resolution modelling capability will remain in place as a legacy of THORPEX-IPY activities.

Taken together the research results from first three objectives the potential to improve future predictions of the weather and climate over the polar regions. Improvement in the initial state means an improved time series of operational and research analyses for climate change research.
 
The final objective is to utilize improved forecast systems to benefit society, economy and environment. High-impact weather events in polar regions include spring thaws, sea ice movement, and severe winter cyclones resulting in strong winds, high seas, and heavy precipitation as defined by their impact on public safety, fisheries and fishery management, activities of the indigenous arctic populations, wildlife, energy production and transportation. These problems are not local to the poles as the intrusion of polar air masses into higher latitudes also has dramatic impacts and many of the polar events are linked to wave trains that are initiated at lower latitudes. During IPY, the major operational forecast centers of the world will co-operate to form a THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) that will form the basis for research on ensemble prediction and on improving society's ability to utilize forecast information. TIGGE will also be made available for IPY field operations.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">As a part of the International Polar Year, NOAA scientists and their U.S. and international colleagues are conducting the Aerosol, Radiation, and Cloud Processes affecting Arctic Climate (ARCPAC) field study. ARCPAC is an airborne research activity to investigate the climate-changing characteristics of pollution in the Arctic. The ARCPAC work is a part of the international POLARCAT (Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements and Models, of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport) research activity.
      
During the spring of 2008, the NOAA WP-3D Orion carried out a series of flights from Fairbanks, Alaska.  The aircraft was outfitted with 26 instruments to transform it into a “flying chemical laboratory” that could measure physical and chemical properties of aerosol fine particles comprising Arctic Haze, cloud properties, and radiation, along with ozone, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and other trace gases that affect climate in the Arctic.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Columbia (OV-102), the first of NASA's orbiter fleet, was delivered to Kennedy Space Center in March 1979. Columbia initiated the Space Shuttle flight program when it lifted off Pad A in the Launch Complex 39 area at KSC on April 12, 1981. It proved the operational concept of a winged, reusable spaceship by successfully completing the Orbital Flight Test Program - missions STS-1 through STS-4.
      
Other, achievements for Columbia included the recovery of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) satellite from orbit during mission STS-32 in January 1990, and the STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences mission in June 1991 - the first manned Spacelab mission totally dedicated to human medical research.
      
Columbia was destroyed over east Texas on its landing descent to Kennedy Space Center on Feb. 1, 2003, at 8:59 a.m. EST at the conclusion of a microgravity research mission, STS-107.
      
Columbia was named after a small sailing vessel that operated out of Boston in 1792 and explored the mouth of the Columbia River. One of the first ships of the U.S. Navy to circumnavigate the globe was named Columbia. The command module for the Apollo 11 lunar mission was also named Columbia.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">INterContinental Atmospheric Transport of Anthropogenic Pollutants to the Arctic</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Anthropogenic pollutants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), other semivolatile organic pollutants (SOCs) and mercury can be transported over long distances from source regions to the remote Arctic. Since the Arctic does not exist alone and it shares a common atmosphere and aqua-sphere with the World, these pollutants can theoretically originate from anywhere globally and be carried to the Arctic by air and ocean currents. Studies conducted under the Northern Contaminants Program (NCP), the Canadian National Implementation Plan of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), as well as others, have associated episodes of high POP concentrations measured on the western North American Arctic with atmospheric transport across the Pacific from potential sources in Asia. Such transport can occur in as short as 5 to 10 days. These pollutants have the tendency of depositing on terrestrial and aquatic surfaces in the Arctic and can bioaccumulate through the Arctic foodchain. Deposition of this kind has been assessed by the Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Project (WACAP) in National Parks along the U.S. and Alaskan Pacific coasts. Due to their environmental persistence and potential toxicity, these pollutants can significantly affect the health of Arctic wildlife and human.
The current project aims at advancing our knowledge in the factors and mechanisms which influence intercontinental transport of pollutants and our understanding of the relative contribution of intercontinental versus intracontinental transport to the Arctic. These objectives can be achieved through coordinated source-receptor measurement of atmospheric pollutants coupled with multi-media transport modelling. It is proposed that simultaneous air sampling for mercury, POPs (e.g. chlordanes, DDTs, dieldrin, hexachlorocyclohexanes [HCHs], toxaphene, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]) and other anthropogenic chemicals (e.g. endosulfan, polybrominated flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs] and current-use pesticides) be conducted along both sides of the Pacific Ocean. These sampling sites include locations in northern China, Vietnam, Japan, eastern Russian Arctic and sub-Arctic, the western Canadian Arctic, Alaska and the west coast of the U.S.A.. Both conventional high volume air sampling (Hivol) and passive air sampling (PAS) methods (in cooperation with the Global Atmospheric Passive Sampling (GAPS) Project and Chinese POPs Air Monitoring Program) for POPs will be used to obtain air samples integrating over different time scales, ranging from 1-2 days (Hivol) to several months to a year (PAS). This allows the assessment of event-based transport episodes versus the overall impact averaged over seasons and years. This will also facilitate the development of PAS which are low cost and require little maintenance. For ambient air mercury measurements all sample analysis will be performed using the Automated Tekran Mercury Vapour Analyser as used in AMAP and NCP sampling sites. A coupled global-scale three-dimensional atmospheric transport and air / soil exchange model developed to investigate the transport of POPs (MEDIA) and the Global/Regional Atmospheric Heavy Metals Model (GRAHM) will be used to forecast trans-Pacific and intracontinental transport episodes of POPs and mercury to facilitate sampling, interpret air monitoring results and estimate the effect of climate change on the long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic. This project will make use of existing air monitoring facilities for POPs established under AMAP, North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) China-Canada Joint Project on Reduction of Lindane Usage in China and its Impact Globally and on North America, as well as other national and university-based studies in Asia and North America. The new site of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy will be initiated in the Eastern Russian sub-Arctic to increase spatial coverage of measurements. Research will focus on:
(1) fingerprinting chemical compositions of air masses from different parts of the Pacific;
(2) identifying key chemical properties, e.g. vapour pressures and air-surface partition coefficients, and atmospheric dynamics, e.g. large-scale wind systems, pressure and geopotential heights, air temperatures, precipitation etc., which dictates chemical transport to the Arctic;
(3) quantifying the relative contribution and major pathways of intercontinental versus intracontinental input of pollutants into the North American Arctic; and establishing background atmospheric circulation patterns for episodic trans-Pacific pollutant transport to the Arctic;
(4) assessing and forecasting the potential influence of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns and climate variability on the long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic.

All Arctic sites involved in this study will also be part of the IPY Core Activities of ATMOPOL ( #76) and COPOL (#175). Results from this project can be linked to the IPY EOI of TRANSARC Pollutants (#50) and other EOIs.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Geographic Correspondence (GeoCorr) is a web-based application for translating (converting) data between different geographic layers from the 1990 Census Summary Tape Files and the Master Area Block Level Equivalency (MABLE) database. Specific geographic layers are selected and custom "correlation lists" are generated showing the relationship between different ... geographies. For example, how ZIP codes correspond to counties, or how census tracts relate to ZIP codes. It can also be used as a tool for looking at a single geographic layer, for example, generating a listing of ZIP codes with population counts. The application can also use x-y coordinates for filtering the data and determining population living within a specified radius of a given location. Output is available as both tabular and comma-separated value (.csv) files.

GeoCorr provides access to all geographic units in the 1990 Census Summary Tape Files as well as several other layers in the MABLE database. These include: Standard census geographies (e.g., state, county, census tract, and place, plus 1980 county, place and tract), Congressional Districts (102nd and 103rd), 5-digit ZIP codes (circa 7/91), 1990 Public Use Microdata Areas (1% and 5% samples), Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), Hydrologic Unit Codes (watersheds), Labor Market Areas and Commuting Zones.

MABLE is a database developed by SEDAC in collaboration with the Office of Social and Economic Data Analysis (OSEDA) at the University of Missouri-Columbia.

GeoCorr is produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).

Short synoptic transects will be undertaken circumpolarly and will radiate outwards across the Antarctic continental shelf and slope. Transects will incorporate insofar as possible:* Closely-spaced full depth CTD/ADCP stations plus profiles of PAR irradiance, bio-optical properties and fluorescence (EoI 9, 57, 310, 573, 585, 596, 635, 911).* Collection throughout the water column at stations of water samples for tracer, chemical and biological analyses including oxygen isotopes, carbon parameters, inorganic and organic nutrients and trace gases, and for biomass on deck incubation experiments to evaluate auto and heterotrophic activities (EoI 9, 573, 585, 596, 635, 911).* Deployment of moored instruments along each transect to measure temperature, salinity, current velocities, sedimentary fluxes and sea level for at least one year (EoI 9, 57, 310, 573, 585, 596, 635).* Deployment on the shelf of autonomous water samplers to collect weekly samples for tracer analyses (EoI 9).* Deployment of ice-hardened surface ocean drifters across the coastal and slope break current systems, measuring temperature, salinity, sea level pressure and location (EoI 9, 310, 573).* Air-sea heat and freshwater flux and meteorological measurements (EoI 9, 573, 585).* Swath bathymetric surveys of the complex shelf and slope terrain, both to assess local circulation and mixing processes, and to detect geological/glaciological phenomena such as iceberg scour (EoI 9, 237, 310, 573, 596).* Sedimentological observations including coring and biostratigraphy (EoI 596, 635)* Turbulent mixing measurements (EoI 9, 310, 573).* Continuation of hydrographic sections poleward beneath ice shelves and/or sea ice using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) such as Autosub (EoI 9) and hot-water drilled access holes (EoI 310).* Use of AUVs to measure sea ice thickness distribution on the Antarctic shelf and slope (EoI 57)* Use of autonomous underwater vehicles and/or instrumented pelagic marine mammals to penetrate beneath sea ice and ice shelves to measure hydrographic and dynamical properties (EoI 9, 585), marine geological, chemical and biological characteristics (EoI 237)Additionally:* We will deploy subsurface Lagrangian floats to be tracked acoustically beneath the seasonal sea ice throughout the winter (EoI 9, 485, 573, 596). These will provide profiles of temperature and salinity, and geographical location, every 10 days. Plans are already in hand to ensonify the Weddell Sea, the offshore region of the Wilkes-Adelie Land and the western margin of the Antarctic Peninsula, to enable use of such floats. Extension of this tracking network to other regions surrounding Antarctica will be undertaken through SASSI to provide polar coverage to the global Argo programme.* Visible, passive microwave and synthetic aperture radar remote sensing (EoI 57, 585, 911) will be used to assess the seasonal/interannual variability of circumpolar coastal polynyas and of phytoplankton biomass. SAR, passive microwave and Cryosat altimetry will allow large scale monitoring of sea ice.* Numerical models will be developed to quantitatively study heat &amp; freshwater fluxes and water mass transformations, and impacts of large iceberg calving events (EoI 57), processes of exchange between ice shelves and the open ocean (EoI 232), tides (EoI 573), biogeochemical cycling of C, N and P (EoI 635), short-term mesoscale instabilities, mixing processes and mass transports associated with gravity plumes across sloping bathymetry (EoI 596). Coupled ice-ocean models (EoI 585) will be analysed, and will assist in developing parameterisation for climate models.* Hot-water drilling through floating ice shelves (EoI 232, 310) will allow sub-ice-shelf CTD profiling and mooring deployment, together with acoustic determinations of basal melt rate.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">INSPIRE is ambitious. The initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. These services should allow the users to identify and access spatial or geographical information from a wide range of sources, from the local level to the global level, in an inter-operable way for a variety of uses. The target users of INSPIRE include policy-makers, planners and managers at European, national and local level and the citizens and their organisations. Possible services are the visualisation of information layers, overlay of information from different sources, spatial and temporal analysis, etc.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The National Resources Inventory (NRI) is a compilation of
natural resource information on non-Federal land in the United
States--about 75 percent of the total land area.

Conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural
Resources Conservation Service in cooperation with the Iowa
State University Statistical Laboratory, this inventory captures
data on land cover and use, soil erosion, prime farmland soils,
wetlands, habitat diversity, selected conservation practices,
and related resource attributes. Data are collected every 5
years from the same 800,000 sample sites in all 50 States,
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and some Pacific Basin
locations. The NRI is a statistically based survey that has been
designed and implemented using scientific principles to assess
conditions and trends of soil, water, and related resources.

The NRI provides a record of trends in the Nation's resources
over time and documents conservation accomplishments as well. At
each sample point, information is available for 1982, 1987,
1992, and 1997, so that trends and changes in land use and
resource characteristics over 15 years can be examined and
analyzed. The NRI provides information for addressing
agricultural and environmental issues at national, regional, and
State levels.

Purpose and Use:

The NRI is conducted to obtain scientific data that is valid,
timely, and relevant on natural resources and environmental
conditions. Through legislation--the Rural Development Act of
1972, the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977, and
other supporting acts--Congress mandates that the NRI be
conducted at intervals of 5 years or less.

Information derived from the NRI is used by natural resource
managers; policymakers; analysts; consultants; the media; other
Federal agencies; State governments; universities;
environmental, commodity, and farm groups; and the public. These
constituents use NRI information to formulate effective public
policies, fashion agricultural and natural resources
legislation, develop State and national conservation programs,
allocate USDA financial and technical assistance in addressing
natural resource concerns, and enhance the public's
understanding of natural resources and environmental issues.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Southern Great Plains 1994 Hydrology Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SGP97 was originally conceived as an airborne experiment for daily mapping of surface soil moisture. In expanding its scope to meet interdisciplinary interests, the main considerations in the experimental design have been (1) maintaining as much spatial airborne coverage as possible on a daily basis; (2) nesting when- and where-ever possible to allow observations at a hierarchy of scales; and (3) making maximum use of existing facilities in the area.

The core of this project is the large scale aircraft soil moisture mapping. Within logistic and fiscal constraints, this experiment will attempt to map surface soil moisture over an area of ~10,000 km2 (order of magnitude larger than previously observed) at a spatial resolution compatible with known data interpretation algorithms (~1 km). The resulting data base would allow the scaling up to projected satellite sized footprints (~10 km) and cover an area large enough to provide over 100 pixels of this size. These data would allow the examination of the information content of coarse resolution data as well as the analysis of the spatial/temporal scales generally utilized in hydrological and hydrometerological models. We will attempt temporal coverage on a daily basis over a period of one month.

Data will be collected using an L band passive microwave mapping instrument called ESTAR which will be flown on a P-3 aircraft. In addition to the L band system, a single beam thermal infrared sensor and a dual polarization C band microwave radiometer will be flown.

The temporal analysis will be enhanced by making continuous 24-hour observations using a truck based microwave radiometer system to complement the once-a-day aircraft measurements. This system consists of L, S, and C band single polarization instruments as well as thermal infrared. It would be located at the DOE ARM CART Central Facility which will provide the most comprehensive temporal observations.

The boundary layer component of SGP97 is configured to primarily evaluate the influence of soil moisture on the local surface energy budget and the influence of mesoscale variability in the surface energy budget on the development of convective boundary layer. To the extent possible, attempts will be made to quantify the water vapor budget of the boundary layer (advection, entrainment, and evapotranspiration) using remotely sensed and in situ data.

Program Title: Utility Acid Precipitation Study Program
To obtain a better understanding of the relationship between power
plant emissions and environmental quality, some 30 electric utilities
formed the Utility Acid Precipitation Study Program (UAPSP) in 1980.
This group sponsored a network of precipitation chemistry monitoring
stations designed to provide long-term, high quality data on the
chemical composition of rainfall, primarily in the eastern U.S.
At several sites, stations have been operated continuously since 1979.
The Electric Power Research Institute's Sulfate Regional Experiment
(SURE) network operated between 1979 and the end of 1980, and the
Utility Acid Precipitation Study Program (UAPSP) network continued on
from the beginning of 1981 until the end of 1987.  At the beginning of
1988 the EPRI Operational Evaluation Network (OEN) began operations
which continued into 1990.
There were also several networks in other parts of the U.S. collecting
daily precipitation chemistry data at about the same time as UAPSP,
the major ones being MAP3S (Multistate Atmospheric Power Production
Pollution Study), WISC (Wisconsin Acid Deposition Monitoring Network)
and FADS (Florida Acid Deposition Study).  UAPSP converted data from
these networks into the standard UAPSP format, and included them in
the database.
See: "http://src.com/~epriasdc/uapsp/uapsp.htm" for information on
the UAPSP program.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">U.S. GLOBEC (GLOBal ocean ECosystems dynamics, http://www.usglobec.org/) is a
research program organized by oceanographers and fisheries scientists to
address the question of how global climate change may affect the abundance and
production of animals in the sea.  The U.S. GLOBEC Program currently has major
research efforts underway in the Georges Bank / Northwest Atlantic Region, and
the Northeast Pacific (with components in the California Current and in the
Coastal Gulf of Alaska).

U.S. GLOBAL OCEAN ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS, NORTHEAST PACIFIC

GOAL:
-To understand the effects of climate variability and climate change on the
distribution, abundance and production of marine animals (including
commercially important living marine resources) in the eastern North Pacific.
-To embody this understanding in diagnostic and prognostic ecosystem models,
capable of capturing the ecosystem response to major climatic fluctuations.

APPROACH: To study the effects of past and present climate variability on the
population ecology and population dynamics of marine biota and living marine
resources, and to use this information as a proxy for how the ecosystems of the
eastern North Pacific may respond to future global climate change. The strong
temporal variability in the physical and biological signals of the NEP will be
used to examine the biophysical mechanisms through which zooplankton and salmon
populations respond to physical forcing and biological interactions in the
coastal regions of the two gyres. Annual and interannual variability will be
studied directly through long-term observations and detailed process studies;
variability at longer time scales will be examined through retrospective
analysis of directly measured and proxy data. Coupled biophysical models of the
ecosystems of these regions will be developed and tested using the process
studies and data collected from the long-term observation programs, then
further tested and improved by hindcasting selected retrospective data series.

Project URL: http://www.tarantella.aq/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=59

TARANTELLA stands for Terrestrial ecosystems in ARctic and ANTarctic: Effects of UV Light, Liquefying ice, and Ascending temperatures. It is a project in the framework of the International Polar Year (http://www.ipy.org, IPY project no. 59)

Predicted changes in climate and ozone concentrations in Polar regions, make it critically important to understand how changes in key environmental factors influence Polar terrestrial ecosystems via the modification of their individual but interconnected components.

TARANTELLA aims to coordinate these studies by focusing on the experimental approach, in both the Arctic, in collaboration with ITEX, and in the Antarctic.

A common methodology is used, the so-called Open-top chambers (OTC) or small greenhouses for temperature manipulations; for UV-B field research UV-B supplementation (lamps) and/or UV-B exclusion (foils), are used to experimentally establish varied UV-B levels. 

The objectives of TARANTELLA are :

    * To compare the effects of experimentally induced climate change and enhanced UV-B radiation
    * To study and analyse effects of temperature (including moisture and nutrient availability) and UV-B radiation manipulations deployed over different periods of time and in different localities
    * To compare the patterns and processes of manipulated with non-manipulated natural controls.
    * To study these changes along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients.
    * To study plant morphological and chemical effects in response to UV-B radiation
    * To test how the balance between facilitation versus competition among autotrophic species varies with temperature and UV-B radiation and other climatic variables
    * To investigate the effects of environmental perturbation on carbon- and nutrient dynamics within and between the different compartments of the ecosystem

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The purpose of SHEBA is to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
 and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1)
 to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice
 processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day
 arctic climate, including its variability, using General Circulation
 Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpretation of satellite
 remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate
 system and provide reliable data for model input, model validation
 and climate monitoring. This work involves development of new
 technology for solar infrared flux measurements at the Arctic Ocean
 surface. Efforts will also be made to develop an all season algorithm
 to retrieve total and multi-year sea ice concentrations from SSM/I
 85.5 Ghz imagery from satellites and conduct a validation of polar
 cloud detection principles, using AVHRR data matched with surface
 all-sky photography and sea ice coverage lo!  gs. This proposal
 focuses on SHEBA PHASE I technological development and analysis of
 existing data sets.

The middle atmosphere program is developing theoretical tools
with which to analyze and interpret data obtained by NRL
experiments (such as MAS, MAHRSI, WVMS, and POAM II). MAHRSI in
particular provides the first global measurements of the
hydroxyl radical (OH) in the stratosphere and mesosphere. This
radical may be the key to understanding the current discrepancy
between model predictions and measurements of stratospheric and
mesospheric ozone.

Data for this project was taken at Volgorrad, Europe and Heiss
Island in the Arctic Ocean.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The research project “DHARMA. Diversity, Heterotrophy, Autotrophy and Relations among Antarctic Microorganisms" was funded by the CICYT (ANT-97-1155). Led by Carlos Pedrós-Alió (ICM, CSIC), the project involved researchers from six Spanish and one foreign institutions. The project was carried out in the waters of the Southern Ocean, in an oceanographic expedition on the BIO Hesperides research vessel where we sampled the Drake Passage waters, the Wedell Sea and the Gerlache Strait. The objectives of this project were:

- To analyze the diversity of microbial communities in surface and deep Antarctic waters, and

- To know the effects of temperature on the different activities of microbial plankton.
Our group was responsible for analyzing the degradation processes of polymeric organic matter carried out by the bacterioplankton.

The Baltic On-line Interactive Geographical and Environmental
Information Service (BOING)Project is a two year project,
running 2000-2001, that will create a prototype website on the
issue of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea: background, causes
and current status. The idea is to use new techniques provided
by the Internet to produce a prototype Internet-based
information service, a working model, of an integrated and
co-ordinated information supply system. Throughout the project,
information providers and users will be in focus.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Dry valley plant-soil systems are very stressed and rely on external resources
(spatial subsidies). The effect(s) of such subsidies on these ecosystems is
largely unexplored, but may influence community and ecosystem level properties.
We plan to conduct an experiment at two sites in Antarctica - a stressed site
(Garwood Valley) and an extreme site (Beacons) where resources may enter by
aerial deposition. We will estimate and use resources of differing quality
(bird droppings, microbial mats, surface foams and dust) and measure how the
decomposer subsystem develops including community composition and diversity,
microbial activity and key decomposer processes including decomposition and
nitrogen release patterns.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: IPY-AP
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=107

Air temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula have risen 6 times faster than the global average in recent decades, triggering glaciological and ecological events unique in the history of this region in the last 1,000 years. In particular, this warming was responsible for the collapse of Larsen A ice shelf in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002. Further south, Larsen C has thinned and continued warming could lead to its breakup within the next decade. 

To date, access to the most active Peninsula regions has been limited, and little baseline glaciological data exist. As a result, large uncertainties remain in the determination of the mass balance of this region. Studies based on remote sensing and available in situ data show that a complex interaction is underway, involving enhanced precipitation at high elevation, enhanced melting at low elevation, sea ice retreat, enhanced surface and basal melting of land and shelf ice; glacier and ice shelf fracturing; melt percolation; seasonal changes in ice flow; and rapid glacial acceleration in the aftermath of ice shelf break-up. As the Larsen A and B ice shelves disintegrated they uncovered a glacial history preserved on the sea-floor indicating the current retreats are rare to unprecedented in the Holocene. 

This proposal represents a combination of interests from GLABENAP, TRAPIS, APICS, and APY; these four activities sought to study ice- and climate-related changes at 3 different latitudes, and therefore 3 different stages of ice response to climate change. GLABENAP aims to investigate glacier response in the northernmost areas of the Peninsula, in the aftermath of the transition from continental Antarctic conditions to sub-polar Cordilleran styles of glaciation; APICS and TRAPIS aim to study the rapid changes where ice shelf retreat and glacier acceleration are underway at present; and APY has an interest in the precursors to this change, in basal melting and the influence of increasing summer surface melt on grounded glaciers further to the south around Larsen C. All 4 studies recognize the importance of climate, paleo-climate, geological and oceanographic influences; and all recognize the profound biological responses to change. This proposal is an umbrella organizational tool for several research projects focused on ice-climate interactions.

We propose an international program of logistical cooperation and scientific collaboration to measure, model, and understand the ongoing climate and glaciological changes in the AP. The results will document the evolution of shelf-glacier systems in a warming climate. Our field science program will install automated observing stations at selected sites, deploy an array of sensors designed to monitor glaciological and geophysical parameters of importance that cannot be collected any other way, and collect critical climate and paleoclimate data. During these campaigns, we will gather baseline data on ice motion, thickness, structure, and internal temperature. The program will also further investigate the sea-floor sedimentary record, promote ongoing west coast ecosystem research, and initiate a program of biological and oceanographic observation along the eastern coast. Remote-sensing-based studies will continue, using both new and existing tools, both airborne and satellite based. We envision a coordinated logistical plan combining US, UK, Chilean, Brazilian and Argentine airborne and ground assets, and we plan US and UK research vessel cruises that would support both land and sea field work. It is our hope that the logistical paths established as part of IPY will lead to continuing and growing cooperation in the Peninsula in the following years.

We will establish an IPY-AP web forum, and organize regular workshop meetings building on recent successful meetings at Hamilton College and SPRI that will provide a venue for discussing results, promoting outreach, and planning research activities.

The Antarctic Peninsula is a model for a future, warmer Antarctica. What we see there are changes of greater scale, speed, and magnitude than were considered possible before. IPY-AP seeks to better observe this system and its responses to know what the future may hold. This region of the World is ideal for international collaboration from geopolitical, logistical and scientific standpoints in the context of IPY.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) was started in 1977
under the State Agricultural Experiment Stations (SAES) to address the
problem of atmospheric deposition and its effect on agricultural
crops, forests, rangelands, surface waters and other natural and
cultural resources. The first monitoring sites of the NADP precipitation
chemistry network was started in 1978 to provide information about
geographical patterns and temporal trends in the deposition of acidic
chemicals and nutrients. The NADP was initially organized as Regional
Project NC-141 by the North Central Region of the SAES. The NADP was
endorsed by all four regions in 1982. when it became Interregional
Project IR-7. Ten years later IR-7 was reclassified as a National
Research Support Project, NRSP-3.

In 1982, the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP)
was established. The NADP assumed responsibility for coordinating the
National Trends Network (NTN) of NAPAP since both the NADP and NTN had
common siting criteria and operational procedures, and shared a common
analytical laboratory. In 1983, the network became the NADP/NTN.
Seven federal agencies support NADP/NTN research and monitoring under
NAPAP: Department of Agriculture (USDA) [Agricultural Research Service
(USDA/ARS), Cooperative Sate Research, Education and Extension Service
(USDA/CSREES), and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS)]; Department of
Commerce (DOC) [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA)]; Department of Energy (DOE) [Argonne National Laboratory
(ANL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL)]; Department of Interior (DOI) [Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), USGS Biological Resources Division (BRD) (formally
the National Biological Service (NBS)), National Park Service (NPS),
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
and the USGS Branch of Technical Development and Quality Systems];
Environmental Protection Agency (EP); National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
Additional support is provided by various other federal agencies,
state agencies, universities, public utilities and industry. There are
curently 200 sites in the network.

The primary objectives of the NADP/NTN network are the determination
of spatial patterns and temporal trends in chemical deposition on
terrestrial ecosystems. The Central Analytical Laboratory (CAL),
operated by the Illinois State Water Survey is responsible for the
chemical analysis and related support services for the entire network.
The NADP/NTN Coordination Office was transferred to the Illinois State
Water Survey in 1998 from Colorado State University.  The NADP/NTN
also has two subnetworks: the Atmospheric Integrated Research
Monitoring Network (AIRMoN) - designed to characterize long-term
trends in the chemical climate of the U.S.; and the Mercury Deposition
Network (MDN) - designed to develop a regional database on the weekly
concentrations of total mercury in precipitation and the seasonal and
annual flux of total mercury in wet deposition.

focus on local and regional research and educational needs, but
as a national network, there are also many system-wide
programs. These programs provide reserves with common research
standards and educational goals.

The National Estuarine Research Reserves System helps to fulfill
NOAA's stewardship mission to sustain healthy coasts by
improving the nation's understanding and stewardship of
estuaries. Established by the Coastal Zone Management Act of
1972, as amended, the reserve system is a network of 25
protected areas that represent different biogeographic regions
of the United States.

Each reserve is a "living laboratory" in which scientists
conduct research and educators communicate research
results. Reserve staff members work with local communities and
regional groups to address natural resource management issues,
such as nonpoint source pollution, habitat restoration and
invasive species. Through integrated research and education, the
reserves help communities develop strategies to deal
successfully with these coastal resource issues.

To addrress this shortcoming, the Global Water System Project (GWSP) initiiated an international effort to collate the existing dam and reservoir data sets with the aim of providing a single, geographically explicit and reliable database for the scientific community: The Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD).

The development of GRanD primarily aimed at compiling the available reservoir and dam information; correcting it through extensive cross-validation, error checking, and identification of duplicate records, attribute conflicts, or mismatches; and completing missing information from new sources or statistical approaches. The dams were geospatially referenced and assigned to polygons depicting reservoir outlines at high spatial resolution. While the main focus was to include all reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 km³, many smaller reservoirs were added if data were available. The current version 1.1 of GRanD contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams, with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 km³.

The development of the GRanD database has been coordinated by the Global Water System Project, Bonn, Germany, and has been executed in partnership and collaboration between members of the following institutes and organizations: Department of Geography, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; The CUNY Environmental Cross-Roads Initiative, City University of New York, NY, USA; University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA; University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; The Nature Conservancy, Arlington, VA, USA; Conservation Science Program, World Wildlife Fund, Washington, DC, USA; European Environment Agency, Copenhagen, Denmark; Food and Agriculture Organization, Rome, Italy; University of Yamanashi, Japan; University of Greifswald, Germany; University of Frankfurt, Germany; and Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Umeå University, Sweden.

Project URL: http://www.ipy-id63.org/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=63

ICESTAR/IHY will coordinate multinational research on solar-generated events which affect the composition and dynamics of the atmosphere in the terrestrial polar areas. The activity brings together two complementary programmes: the International Heliophysical Year (IHY) (EoI 172) is an international programme to coordinate the use of current and forthcoming spacecraft missions with ground-based observatory instruments to study the Sun's influence on the heliosphere, including effects at the Earth; ICESTAR (EoI 554), endorsed by SCAR, aims to coordinate research on magnetospheric and ionospheric responses to solar inputs, with emphases on the networking of ground-based instrument networks and the study of inter-hemispheric relationships. 

The proposed joint project includes the collective effort of 24 international consortia which submitted their Expressions of Intent (EoIs) to the IPY call in January 2005. Between them, these groups already run a large body of instrumentation in both the Arctic and the Antarctic to support this research programme. Several consortia are also proposing to install new instruments in the polar regions to significantly improve the spatial coverage and resolution and to provide pairs of geomagnetically conjugate observations from both the hemispheres. The resulting observations and value-added data products will be used together with state-of-the-art models and simulations to improve our quantitative understanding of the near-Earth space environment. 

The scientific goals of the 24 EoIs can be categorised under the following three main themes: 

(i) Coupling processes between the different atmospheric layers and their connection with the solar activity: E.g. effects of mid-atmospheric circulation and extreme solar activity on the content of stratospheric ozone and minor constituents, variations of the cosmic ray fluxes above the polar areas and South Atlantic Anomaly, energy transfer from powerful weather fronts to geospace heights and using novel technology for stratospheric magnetic field measurements.

(ii) Energy and mass exchange between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere: E.g. multiscale and tomographic studies of ionospheric phenomena (auroral precipitation, convection, turbulence and electron content) as driven by magnetospheric and solar activity, remote-sensing of the radiation belts, and balloon-borne radio soundings of the ionosphere in conjunction with ground stations and satellites as pilot studies for future NASA missions.

(iii) Inter-hemispheric similarities and asymmetries in geospace phenomena: Science goals as above but under this theme special emphasis will be put on using both Arctic and Antarctic observations. In addition to several magnetometer and optical instrument networks bipolar data will be available also from HF-radars, riometers, digital ionosondes, dynasondes, dual-frequency GPS receivers and LEO satellite beacon receivers.

Each project in the combined proposal has a set of project-specific scientific objectives, but the interrelationships between the studied processes mean there is significant synergy between the projects. The result is that the overall proposal will be able to address topics with far-reaching scientific impact and of importance to society at large. For example, a practical benefit will be improved prediction of space weather phenomena which adversely affect spacecraft operations, humans in space, and satellite-based positioning systems; on the scientific side, global scale coordination of observing networks will allow us to study conjugate and multi-scale geospace phenomena in fundamentally new ways.

IHY will coordinate an overarching synoptic observation programme and will provide systems and assessment processes for coordinating and facilitating dedicated campaigns in order to reap the advantages of interdisciplinary observations. To facilitate data sharing, ICESTAR will lead an effort to establish a set of Virtual Observatories in accordance with concept of the Electronic Geophysical Year (eGY). Frequently updated web-pages will be the most effective way to disseminate the scientific results. Special sessions at international meetings and dedicated workshops will provide other channels to reach the broader community and to efficiently collect feedback. The public awareness of ICESTAR/IHY activities will be increased with popular articles and web-pages and with regularly coordinated media events.

RSV-INTREPID provides for two 40 day summer voyages of scientific investigation involving 50 students and 60 scientists (the students selected on merit from their second last year at school from Australia and 87 other countries). Each student will be tasked with three investigative programs designed to complement IPY dedicated projects. Our multi-disciplinary approach is aimed to give students the widest possible exposure to polar science. Intensive ship-board and shore-based investigative and experimental projects will be led and mentored by young scientists working with small student groups.We aim to consult with other EOI's to develop specialised student programs and to foster and develop joint EO and C objectives. We expect close communication and interaction to develop between our students, young science mentors and IPY project leaders. Each student will be required to prepare an investigative report which will be published in The Society's "Proceedings" and appear on RSV-INTREPID's website. We aim to establish an RSV-INTREPID Base Station for the duration of The IPY partnered by AUSTEOC.

The High-Altitude Sampling Program (HASP) database provides
information on EML's archived stratospheric air filter samples
and sample measurements. The HASP program was first established
in 1957 to track the global dispersion of radioactive debris
resulting from atmospheric nuclear testing. Stratospheric air
filter samples and gas samples were collected at several
locations in North and South America and analyzed for nuclear
debris/trace gases.

The database includes several sets of information about archived
samples and data. The High-Altitude Balloon Sampling Program,
Project Ashcan, ran from 1956 to 1983. This program used large
polyethylene balloons to collect samples at altitudes from 20-27
km. The Stardust program used WU-2, RB-57F, RB-57C, and C-130
aircraft to collect samples at altitudes of 6-19 km, and ran
from 1961 through 1967. However, there were earlier aircraft
samples also collected (1957-1961), which were simply called the
High-Altitude Sampling Program at the time, and which are
treated here as belonging to Project Stardust due to
similarities in collection and analysis procedures. In 1967, the
aircraft sampling continued under the Airstream program, which
was discontinued in 1983.

The Monterey Area Ship Tracks experiment took place on June 11 - June 30,
1994 on the Central California Coast.
The objective of the experiment was to determine if upwelling and emissions
from ships and submarines affect cloud formation and if they can be detected
remotely by looking for ocean surface temperature and cloud anomolies.

The Sierra Nevada Global Change Research Program began in
1991. Originally funded by the National Park Service, and now funded
by the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey,
the program has involved more than 20 scientists from ten research
institutions. The program set out to explore the fundamental character
and significance of forest changes driven by the two most powerful
agents of change in the Sierra Nevada: climate and fire. Studies are
organized around three time periods: past, present and future. This
organizational approach--modern mechanistic studies and extensive
paleoecological studies informing one another under the integrative
framework of state-of-the-art computer models--is a uniquely powerful
way of exploring the character and significance of forest change.

The Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, conducts sustained
observations and research related to source and sink strengths, trends
and global distributions of atmospheric constituents that are capable
of forcing change in the climate of Earth through modification of the
atmospheric radiative environment, those that may cause depletion of
the global ozone layer, and those that affect baseline air
quality. CMDL accomplishes this mission primarily through long-term
measurements of key atmospheric species at sites spanning the globe,
including four fully-equipped Baseline Observatories. These key
species include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, surface and stratospheric ozone, halogenated compounds
including CFC replacements, hydrocarbons, sulfur gases, aerosols, and
solar and infrared radiation. The measurements are of the highest
quality and accuracy possible, and document global changes in key
atmospheric species, which are all affected by mankind, identifying
sources of interannual variability. In addition, research programs in
key regions, utilizing an array of platforms including aircraft,
balloons, ocean vessels and towers, complement the land-based
information. CMDL's data are used to assess climate forcing, ozone
depletion and baseline air quality, to develop and test diagnostic and
predictive models, and to keep the public, policy makers, and
scientists abreast of the current state of our chemical and radiative
atmosphere.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Atmospheric cyclones in the Fram Strait affect the sea ice transport from the Arctic Ocean into the Atlantic Ocean. During the field experiment FRAMZY in April 1999 a Fram Strait cyclone and its impact on the ice drift was measured using a research aircraft and an array of 15 ice buoys. The synoptic-scale cyclone moved from the south into the area. It was discernible up to 500 hPa in the pressure field, but the horizontal temperature contrast of up to 16 K between the warm and cold sides was confined to the lowest 500 m. The average ice drift was 0.21 ms−1 toward 200° but increased to 0.6 ms−1 during the cyclone passage. The ice drift amounted to 1.6% of the geostrophic wind with a turning angle of 51° on the average. Comparisons between the aircraft measurements and operational weather model analyses show an insufficient representation of the temperature inversion and indicate an underestimate of wind speed and, thus, momentum transfer to the sea ice.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=179

For fifteen years the NASA-sponsored Earth System Science Education for the 21st Century (ESSE 21) and precursor programs have fostered among colleges and universities an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the Earth as a system of interrelated air, water, land, life and social processes. Led by the Universities Space Research Association (USRA), ESSE 21 offers colleges and universities small, competitive grants to develop Earth system science courses, curricula, and degree programs. ESSE 21 engages a collaborative community of educators and scientists as partners in jointly developing and sharing courses and learning resources focused on Earth system science research and application. ESSE 21 places special emphasis on reaching minority serving institutions. Sixty-three teams have been funded since 1991 supporting faculty from different disciplines to come together to develop and offer courses with relevant and compelling science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) content focused on understanding Earth. ESSE 21 participants stimulate their students' critical and creative thinking with Earth system models, research results, data and visualizations available from NASA and the broader interdisciplinary community engaged in Earth system science. These resources increase opportunities for teaching and learning about the Earth as a system while developing competency in underlying STEM principles.

Understanding the Earth as a system is central to the IPY theme. ESSE 21 and IPY share common goals, seeking to attract and develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, leaders and citizens mindful of Earth system connections. The IPY seeks to make the polar regions and processes better known to people beyond the polar regions and offers an opportunity for people living in the Arctic to strengthen their communication with the rest of the world. An ESSE 21 partnership with the IPY will forward the goals of both organizations. ESSE 21 seeks to increase awareness of IPY science themes and learning resources in the broader undergraduate ESS community being served by the program, focus interest in the role of polar regions in ESS among the ESSE 21 participants and others, and foster collaboration between the ESS educators and the broader IPY science and education partners.

ESSE 21 will include a section on the International Polar Year (IPY) as a topical supplement to its Design Guide for Undergraduate Earth System Science Education. ESSE 21 intends to develop partnerships with other organizations that have submitted Expressions of Interest, such as EoI 404, which represents a cluster of 17 organizations commited to IPY education. Other EoIs that will be contacted to explore ways that ESSE 21 can contribute include 196, 315, 341, 468.

NASA officially announced its intent to develop the Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite (UARS) in 1979. Nine instruments and a group of
theoretical investigators were chosen by an open proposal selection
process. An additional instrument, ACRIM, was given a flight of
opportunity on the UARS spacecraft. Due to funding delays and the
Challenger accident, UARS was not launched until 1991. UARS is
considered the first of the Mission to Planet Earth (now Earth Science
Enterprise) series of NASA spacecraft.

UARS was launched on September 15, 1991 by the Space Shuttle
Discovery. It is 35 feet long, 15 feet in diameter, weighs 13,000
pounds, and carries 10 instruments. UARS orbits at an altitude of 375
miles with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees. Designed to operate
for three years, eight of its ten instruments are still
functioning. UARS measures ozone and chemical compounds found in the
ozone layer which affect ozone chemistry and processes. UARS also
measures winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the
energy input from the Sun. Together, these help define the role of the
upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability.

The UARS Project Mission Objectives are to study the
a) energy input and loss in the upper atmosphere
b) global photochemistry of the upper atmosphere
c) dynamics of the upper atmosphere
d) coupling among these processes
e) coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere

Four UARS instruments were devoted to measurements of constituents
that spectroscopically determine the concentrations of many different
chemical species and derived the variation of atmospheric temperature
with altitude by observing infrared emissions from carbon dioxide
(CO2). The instruments are:
1) Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES)
2) Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS)
3) Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)
4) Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE)

Two instruments, utilizing high-resolution interferometry, will studied
upper-atmosphere winds by sensing the Doppler shift in light absorbed
by or emitted from atmospheric molecules. The wind instruments are:
1) High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI)
2) Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII)

An additional four investigations obtained estimates of the energy
incident on the atmosphere by measuring solar ultraviolet radiation
and the flux of charged particles from the Earth's magnetosphere.
These are:
1) Solar-Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE)
2) Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM)
3) Particle Environment Monitor (PEM)
4) Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM II)

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Southern Ocean Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Southern Ocean Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey (SO-CPR) is an international program supported by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Action Group on CPR Research through the Standing Scientific Group on Life Sciences of SCAR. Current member nations are Australia, Japan, Germany and New Zealand. Other nations are encouraged to participate. The Survey is a major contributor to the Census of Antarctic Marine Life and SCAR's Marine Biodiversity Information Network SCAR-MarBIN. 

The overall purposes of the Survey are to map the spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity of the plankton through the region, and then to use the sensitivity of plankton to environmental change as early warning indicators of the health of Southern Ocean. The Survey will also serve as a reference on the general status of the Southern Ocean for comparison with other monitoring programs.

Understanding patterns of variation in biological systems, both natural and those caused climate change, is an integral pattern of research in Antarctica. Plankton are the foundation of the Antarctic marine ecosystem and are thus the logical place to start such research. The CPR has proved to be the most cost-effective means of rapidly and repeatedly surveying plankton in large ocean systems with minimal or no cost in ship time. The CPR provides contiguous maps of zooplankton over large areas ideal for biogeographic mapping, especially in relation to frontal zones, and providing spatial-temporal variation in zooplankton community structure.
 
The SO-CPR Survey is an independent established program, but is part of a larger consortium CPR surveys in the North Sea, North Atlantic and North Pacific, operating through the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS), that is providing an important survey tool on the health of ocean systems as well as supporting specific research such as the Census of Marine Life (CoML) and Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML).

The USDA UV-B Monitoring and Research Program is a program of
the US Department of Agriculture's Cooperative State Research,
Education and Extension Service (CSREES). The program was
initiated in 1992, through a grant to Colorado State University,
to provide information on the geographical distribution and
temporal trends of UVB (ultraviolet -B) radiation in the United
States. This information is critical to the assessment of the
potential impacts of increasing ultraviolet radiation levels on
agricultural crops and forests.

This program provides:

1. information to the agricultural community and others about
the climatological and geographical distribution of UVB
irradiance;

2. basic information necessary to support evaluations of the
potential damage effects of UVB to agricultural crops and
forests;

3. ground truth for satellite measurements and basic information
for radiation transfer model calculations;

4. long-term records of UVB irradiance necessary to assess trends;

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Environmental Monitoring for Public Access and Community Tracking</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
EMPACT is a new approach to working with communities to collect,
manage, and present environmental information. It aims to work with
communities to make timely, accurate, and understandable environmental
information available to millions of people in the largest
metropolitan areas across the country so that communities and
individuals can make informed, day- to- day decisions about their
lives.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has started a number of
projects that work with communities which provide environmental
information to communities and individuals by means of the latest
measurement,information management, and communications technologies. These
initial EPA projects, for example,will:

  Develop improved air quality tracking systems for the Cleveland, OH area.
  Provide immediate clean-water information at Los Angeles, CA beaches.
  Provide daily information to help children avoid harmful exposure to
   ultraviolet radiation in Phoenix, AZ.
  Keep track of water quality in Long Island Sound, NY.
  Reduce the risk of lead exposure to children in their own backyards in
   the Boston, MA area.
  Provide information on contamination at hazardous-waste sites in
   Northern New Jersey.
  Keep better track of toxic air pollutants in the San Francisco, CA area.

EPA will coordinate EMPACT activities among Federal, States, tribal,
and local governments. Additionally, groups such as community health
officials, businesses, industries, schools, and environmental
organizations will be involved.

To help make EMPACT work, EPA will work closely with two other Federal
agencies: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The resources and expertise of
these two agencies will help EPA achieve nationwide consistency in
measuring environmental data, managing that data, and effectively
delivering it to the public. Data obtained from both NOAA and USGS
will also help EPA get a truer, more complete picture of our
environment, coast to coast.

ARCSS is the only element of the U.S. Global Change Research Program specifically concerned with the arctic region. By focusing on understanding Arctic processes in great detail, investigators are better able to characterize global changes through the improvement of global-scale models and other research tools. 

A major concern of the arctic research community is the availability of reliable data for research. The ARCSS Data Coordination Center (ADCC), while working with ARCSS investigators, the ARCSS Committee, Science Management Offices and NSF, is continually acquiring data and developing data products appropriate and useful for the research community. Integrating data and information from among the ARCSS ocean-based, land-based, ice core, paleoclimate and human-dimension communities is a high priority at the ADCC.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">CLIVAR- An International Programme on Climate Variability and Predictability

CLIVAR is an international research programme investigating climate
variability and predictability on time-scales from months to decades
and the response of the climate system to anthropogenic
forcing. CLIVAR, as one of the major components of the World Climate
Research Programme (WCRP), started in 1995 has a lifetime of 15 years.

The overall purpose and goal of CLIVAR is:

To describe and understand climate variability and predictability on
seasonal to centennial time-scales, identify the physical processes
responsible, including anthropogenic effects, and develop modeling and
predictive capabilities where practicable.

The specific CLIVAR Objectives are:

Describe and understand the physical processes responsible for climate
variability and predictability on seasonal, interannual, decadal and
centennial time scales, through the collection and analysis of
observations and the development and application of models of the
coupled climate system and its component parts, in co-operation with
other relevant climate research and observing programmes;

Extend the record of climate variability over the time scales of
interest through the assembly of quality-controlled paleoclimate and
instrumental data sets;

Extend the range and accuracy of seasonal to interannual climate
prediction through the development of global coupled predictive
models;

Understand and predict the response of the climate system to increases
of radiatively active gases and aerosols and to compare these
predictions with the observed climate record in order to detect any
anthropogenic modification of the natural climate signal.

    * What are the gas transfer velocities at high winds?
    * What is the effect of fetch on the gas transfer?
    * How do other non-direct wind effects influence gas transfer?
    * How do changing pCO2 and DMS levels affect the air-sea CO2 and DMS flux, respectively in the same locale?
    * Are there better predictors of gas exchange in the Southern Ocean other than wind?
    * What is the near surface horizontal and vertical variability in turbulence, pCO2, and other relevant biochemical and physical parameters?
    * How do biological processes influence pCO2 and gas exchange?
    * Do the different disparate estimates of fluxes agree, and if not why?
    * With the results from Southern Ocean GasEx, can we reconcile the current discrepancy between model based CO2 flux estimates and observation based estimates?

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The National Integrated Land System (NILS) project is a phased
effort to develop a common data model and toolset for managing
land records in a Geographic Information System (GIS)
environment.  The common data model and toolset will meet the
core survey and parcel management business requirements of the
Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service.

The four NILS models include:

1. Survey Management:

Survey Management is a set of applications that provides
surveyors with the ability to manage survey data collected in
the field. It allows for exporting data to a variety of survey
equipment and for importing data back into the Survey Management
database. GIS, raster, and field data are all integrated within
Survey Management for data validation and decision making while
in the field. Survey Management will provide field surveyors
with tools to research survey data that can be taken into the
field. Additional tools will assist in the calculation of field
data and observations. A subset of coordinate geometry and
layout calculation tools will also be available. Next
implementation is scheduled for March 2003.


2. Measurement Management:

Measurement Management is a desktop GIS application that allows
surveyors to analyze and adjust surveyed data from the
field. Measurement Management allows for the combination of
measurement data from a variety of sources and reliabilities to
create a seamless measurement network. Measurement Management
contains a suite of mathematical formulas that allow the
transformation of raw survey data into the measurement
network. This is referred to as the legal description
fabric. The legal description fabric can then be used to create
the parcel fabric, which can be used by land managers for
decision making.

Measurement Management contains tools to input and import data,
construct measured features, edit measurement data, adjust and
analyze the measurement network, perform least square
adjustments, perform coordinate geometry and layout, and create
a parcel fabric. Next implementation is scheduled for March
2003.

3. Parcel Management:

Parcel Management will be a desktop GIS application that
provides tools for land managers to create and manage parcel
features and their legal area descriptions. The parcel fabric
can be vertically integrated with survey features captured and
managed using the Survey and Measurement Management
applications. A set of tools for standardizing and facilitating
land management workflow processes will be provided with the
parcel management suite of tools.

4. GeoCommunicator:

GeoCommunicator is an interactive Web-based land information
portal, powered by ESRI's Geography Network, that uses the
Internet to effectively deliver maps, geographic activities, map
and image services, clearinghouses, spatial solutions, reference
documents, potential cost sharing partners, and much more to
individual user browsers and desktops, allowing data providers,
service providers, and users throughout the United States to
communicate, access, and share land-based information.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=38

OASIS is an international multi-disciplinary effort to study Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snowpack Interactions in the Arctic. The specific focus is to develop a quantitative understanding of the processes that are involved in Air-Surface Interactions and chemical exchange between the title reservoirs. As the nature and extent of snow and ice cover is changing, OASIS will assess the associated impact on, and by, climate change, and the human and ecosystem impacts of air-surface exchanges of chemical species.
OASIS will quantify the impact of chemical, physical and biological exchange processes on tropospheric chemistry, the cryosphere, and the marine environment, and their feedback mechanisms in the context of a changing climate. OASIS has identified studies in the Arctic Ocean surface environment as a key programmatic component to reach these goals. 

The OASIS program was established in 2003, and has developed an internationally vetted Science Plan, and an Implementation Plan, available at http://www.OASISHome.net. A growing number of individual projects are contributing to the scientific goals since winter 2004/05. OASIS is linked to a number of international organizations and activities, including AMAP (the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program), and the IGBP (International Geosphere - Biosphere) programs IGAC (International Global Atmospheric Chemistry) under the AICI (Air Ice Chemical Interactions) activity, and SOLAS (Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">CACHE will use data from ice cores, ocean sediments, lake sediments and contemporary measurements of atmospheric chemistry to cast new light on the climate of the last million years. The objective is to determine the key drivers and feedbacks that have controlled climate change and the chemistry of the global atmosphere past and present, and to improve computer models used to predict climate change. Main objectives are to: Extend the existing 10,000-year climate record for the Americas by sampling from the sub-Antarctic, through the Antarctic Peninsula to the South Pole; Understand the relationship between the Antarctic and global climate over timescales up to a million years; Determine the main causes and amplifiers of climate change over the last ~1My; Quantify the chemical exchanges between the atmosphere and Antarctic ice and snow;  Understand how changes in the amount of ice and snow on Earth affect the chemistry of the atmosphere.

CACHE will drill and analyze the first complete Holocene ice core climate record from the Antarctic Peninsula. The results will be combined with those from the cores recently extracted from Dome C and Berkner Island, existing data from other sectors of Antarctica, and other climate history data worldwide. This will provide an unprecedented record of the links between carbon cycle. 

Component Projects of CACHE are: CACHE-CEFAC: Chemical Exchange and Feedbacks between the Atmosphere and Cryosphere; CACHE-DRAM: DRivers and AMplifiers of late Quaternary climate change ; and CACHE-PEP: Natural climate variability - extending the Americas Pole-Equator-Pole palaeoclimate transect through the Antarctic Peninsula to the Pole

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Towards an Operational Prediction sys. for N. Atlantic European coastal Zones</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Following the encouraging results of the DIADEM  MAST-III project, TOPAZ aims
at providing real-time forecasts for both the physics and ecology of the North
Atlantic ocean. 

As its predecessor, TOPAZ develops advanced data assimilation systems for a
coupled primitive equation ocean circulation and marine ecosystem model for the
North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas with enhanced resolution in the European
coastal zones, assimilating satellite data available for real time operational
use.

TOPAZ keeps improving the results obtained in DIADEM, partly thanks to the
increased computer resources recently available. Our strategy is to take
advantage of the newly available CPU and memory space for upgrading both the
circulation and the ecological models and for increasing their resolution.
Besides, the efficiency of the various data assimilation schemes is improved. 

Features of the new model system are the following :
-------------------------------------------
* The Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM) is replaced by the Hybrid
Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). It adds a fixed vertical coordinate to the
original isopycnic coordinate and allows for a better description of the
vertical movements of water masses.
* The original ecological model by Fasham, Ducklow and Mc Kelvie (FDM model) is
improved so that the phytoplankton can adapt to changes in the physical and
biogeochemical environment. In particular, the new model allows variable carbon
to nitrogen (C:N) and carbon to chlorphyll ratios (C:N-REcoM= C:N Regulated
Ecosystem Model).
* An ice model is coupled to the physical model HYCOM, and measurements of ice
concentration and ice thickness are assimilated.
* The model grid resolution is increased (18 to 35 km), and a common
discretization for both the physics and biology is now possible, which
simplifies their coupling.

The data assimilation schemes used in the TOPAZ project are:
---------------------------------------------------
    * The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF, used in the real-time experiment).
    * The Singular Evolutive Extended Kalman Filter (SEEK).
    * The Ensemble Optimal Interpolation (EnOI) scheme.

The observations used are satellite observed Sea Level Anomaly (SLA), Sea
Surface Temperature (SST), Sea-ice concentrations from SSMI and - soon -
Coriolis in-situ data.

The major outcomes in terms of products are short term forecasts issued weekly,
open for public access and end users.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A deep-sea project documenting species diversity of abyssal plains to increase understanding of the historical causes and ecological factors regulating biodiversity and global change.
Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) is one of seven initial field projects of the Census of Marine Life (CoML). The goal of this project is to document actual species diversity of abyssal plans as a basis for global change research and for a better understanding of historical causes and actual ecological factors regulating biodiversity. To achieve this, CeDAMar will collect reliable data on the large-scale distribution of one of the largest and most inaccessible environments on our planet.
 
The Deep Unkown
The deep sea harbors vast numbers of species, most of which are still unknown. Global estimates of marine species vary between 500,000 and 10 million. Since there is no inventory of the fauna of even a single ocean basin, extrapolation of total species numbers of the global abyssal fauna is impossible or at best very speculative. The program will focus on benthic, epibenthic and hyperbenthic organisms because of their high species-richness.

The study of the deep sea offers a number of advantages. Environmental factors appear to be more homogenous in the deep sea than in many other environments and are easier to measure due to the relative uniformity of large areas. Anthropogenic effects are reduced, and communities are for the most part found in their natural state. Geological information on kinds and age of the sediments in the deep sea is available from past and ongoing projects.

Scientific Objectives
CeDAMar will develop standardized protocols for surveying marine organisms in abyssal marine sediments, including reliable collecting devices in order to avoid damage to fragile deepsea animals. The standard protocols will enable results from different ocean basins will be comparable today as well as in the future. CeDAMar will also contribute to the development and testing of new, more efficient collecting techniques.

Samples will be collected along approximately 1000 km long transects. To exclude small-scale variations which could influence biodiversity estimations, larger areas will be sampled with an epibenthic sledge and repeated box corer (or new devices with the same function) and multicorer hauls. Underwater cameras will document the morphology of the ocean bed, the effects of bioturbation and the abundance of microfauna. The collected material will be analyzed with modern systematic methods.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Many of the mutagenic or lethal effects of ionizing radiation can be traced to structural and chemical modification of cellular DNA through double-strand breaks (DSB) and clustered lesions. Although the development of mechanistic models of radiation damage in DNA has reached a high level of sophistication, further refinements are needed to understand fully the underlying mechanisms in particular on a molecular level. The proposed studies are designed to provide, in a comprehensive manner, missing information about the molecular pathways that lead from initial deposition of radiative energy to the formation of double strand breaks and lesions in DNA.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">CENSUS OF MARINE LIFE</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Census of Marine Life is a global network of researchers in more than 80 nations engaged in a 10-year scientific initiative to assess and explain the diversity, distribution, and abundance of life in the oceans. The world's first comprehensive Census of Marine Life - past, present, and future - will be released in 2010.

The stated purpose of the Census of Marine Life is to assess and explain the diversity, distribution, and abundance of marine life. Each plays an important role in what is known, unknown, and may never be known about what lives in the global ocean.

First, diversity. The Census aims to make for the first time a comprehensive global list of all forms of life in the sea. No such unified list yet exists. Census scientists estimate that about 230,000 species of marine animals have been described and reside in jars in collections in museums of natural history and other repositories. Since the Census began in 2000, researchers have added more than 5600 species to the lists. They aim to add many thousands more by 2010. The database of the Census already includes records for more than 16 million records, old and new. By 2010, the goal is to have all the old and the new species in an on-line encyclopedia with a webpage for every species. In addition, we will estimate how many species remain unknown, that is, remain to be discovered. The number could be astonishingly large, perhaps a million or more, if all small animals and protists are included. For comparison, biologists have described about 1.5 million terrestrial plants and animals.

Second, distribution. The Census aims to produce maps where the animals have been observed or where they could live, that is, the territory or range of the species. Knowing the range matters a lot for people concerned about, for example, possible consequences of global climate change.

Third, abundance. No Census is complete without measures of abundance. We want to know not only that there is such a thing as a Madagascar crab but how many there are. For marine life, populations are being estimated either in numbers or in total kilos, called biomass.

To complete the context, it is important to understand the top motivations for the Census of Marine Life. Most importantly, much of the ocean is unexplored. Most of the records in its database are for observations near the surface, and down to 1000 meters. No observations have been made in most of the deep ocean, while most of the ocean is deep.

Another important issue is that diversity varies in space. Marine hot spots, like the rain forests of the land, exist off for large fish off the coasts of Brazil and Australia. The goal is to know much more about marine hot spots, to help conserve these large fish. Their abundance and thus their diversity is changing, especially for commercially important species. Between 1952 and 1976, for example, fishermen and their customers emptied many areas of the ocean of tuna.

The Census has evolved a strategy of 14 field projects to touch the major habitats and groups of species in the global ocean. Eleven field projects address habitats, such as seamounts or the Arctic Ocean. Three field projects look globally at animals that either traverse the seas or appear globally distributed: the top predators such as tuna and the plankton and the microbes. The projects employ a mix of technologies. These include acoustics or sound, optics or cameras, tags placed on individual animals that store or report data, and genetics, as well as some actual capture of animals. The technologies complement one another. Sound can survey large areas in the ocean, while light cannot. Light can capture detail and characters that sound cannot. And genetics can make identifications from fragments of specimens or larvae where pictures tell little.

This mix of curiosity, need to know, technology, and scientists willing to investigate the unexplored and undiscovered will result in a Census of Marine Life in 2010 that provides a much clearer picture of what lives below the surface around the globe. Several reasons make such a report timely, indeed urgent. Crises in the sea are reported regularly. One recent study predicted the end of commercial fishery globally by 2050, if current trends persist. Better information is needed to fashion the management that will sustain fisheries, conserve diversity, reverse losses of habitat, reduce impacts of pollution, and respond to global climate change. Hence, there are biological, economic, philosophical and political reasons to push for greater exploration and understanding of the ocean and its inhabitants. Indeed, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity requires signatories to collect information on living resources, but, as yet, no nation has a complete baseline of such information. The Census of Marine Life's global network of researchers will help to fill this knowledge gap, providing critical information to help guide decisions on how to manage global marine resources for the future.

The improved technology for passive monitoring will allow us to expand the range of marine mammal species monitored to include the largest odontocetes: sperm (Physeter macrocephalus), killer (Orcinus orca), beaked (Mesoplodon spp), and possibly southern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon planifrons), all the mysticetes known to inhabit the Southern Ocean: blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus), sei (B. borealis), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), southern right (Eubalaena australis), and minke whales (B. bonaerensis), as well as most pinnipeds: leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii), crabeater (Lobodon carcinophagus), Ross (Ommatophoca rossii), southern elephant (Mirounga leonine), and fur seals. Fish choruses should also be present in these data and are know to produce sounds with diurnal variability. The acoustic data will be used to investigate the seasonality and abundance of these species in the Southern Ocean, as well as the ways that physical and biological processes interact to determine the patterns of distribution and abundance of cetaceans in the Antarctic.

At the same time this project will fill a large gap in global seismic coverage by placing seafloor seismic sensors at Southern Ocean locations, far from existing sites. These seismic sensors will lead to a more uniform coverage for seismic wave propagation within the Earth, and better understanding of local seismicity in the Southern Ocean.

The recording packages that we propose to deploy in the Southern Ocean are a proto-type ocean observatory. They have significant data recording capacity (1600 Gbytes) and can support batteries sufficient for year-long deployments of seismic, acoustic and other sensors. We plan to expand the range of sensors recorded by these instruments beyond the seismic/acoustic sensors currently proposed, and in so doing create a facility for long-term multi-disciplinary observations.

This proposal will have a broader impact on society by providing support for graduate education, developing infrastructure for future multi-disciplinary observation platforms, and providing support for outreach projects. The development of SHARPs will advance our capabilities for scientific monitoring and will serve as starting platforms for future, more integrated observation stations. This project will serve as an educational platform to enable K-12 students to virtually experience Antarctica in a way that represents its geographic and biologic diversity. To this end, we will incorporate educational material gathered from this experiment into our museum exhibit “Voices in the Sea” at the Aquarium of the Pacific (Long Beach, CA),

GEOSCOPE, the Interactive Global Change Encyclopedia, is a project that is
being jointly developed by the Canadian Space Agency and by the Canada Centre
for Remote Sensing.  It was developed in the context of International Space
Year 1992.
The objective of this project is to demonstrate to a large number of people
in the world, through hands-on experience, that satellite data and other
geographic information can be of vital importance in monitoring the global
environment.  GEOSCOPE will illustrate the profound changes occurring on the
global and regional scales through the story-like exercises called scenarios.
In addition to the more than 100 data sets, several scenarios covering a whole
range of interesting scientific topics will be available to the users.
Numerous agencies have contributed data for inclusion in GEOSCOPE, particularly
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Other contributors include
SAFISY (Space Agency Forum on International Space Year), United Nations
Environment Programme, World Resources Institute, NASDA, SPOT IMAGE, EROS Data
Center and DLR.  Their support has made this ambitious project a reality.
Under the auspices of SAFISY, over 40 space agencies and international
organizations aim at promoting a new era of space cooperation globally,
and at enhancing our knowledge of Planet Earth.  GEOSCOPE is an example of
this collaboration.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The main objective of the AMICS network proposal is to contribute to the international research effort leading to an improved understanding of the dynamic behaviour of the Antarctic ice sheet resulting from climatic change. More specifically it aims at a better knowledge of the internal dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet and to a better assessment of the interactions of the ice sheet with its boundary conditions. The major components of this interdisciplinary research objective are modelling and ice composition studies.

The aim of this research network is to clarify the dynamic interactions between the ice sheet and its boundary conditions, such as the substratum, based on analysis of ice from the basal part of the Antarctic ice sheet and ice-sheet modelling. Results from the analyses will put constraints on the basal boundary conditions of the numerical model and will make validation of the model possible with regard to the melting and refreezing processes at the base. Further constraints come from radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys and SAR interferometric applications. For this purpose, the high-resolution numerical model of complex ice flow will be adapted to three-dimensions and refined. With the numerical model we hope to translate the results of the ice-composition analyses into physical processes, hence providing the scientific community with a model tool of complex basal interaction. As basal processes play an important role in the onset of fast-flowing areas such as ice streams, the role of ice streams, outlet glaciers and ice shelves in the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet and their influence on the variability of the ice sheet with changing climate will be investigated.

The overall objective of CARE/ASR is to explore, quantify and model Arctic climate change, its interaction with the climate in lower latitudes and its impact on Arctic marine ecosystems, and to assess the socio-economic consequences for Europe. 

The specific objectives are: 
1. To determine the processes responsible for the past and present variability and changes in the Arctic climate system and to improve their representation in climate models. 
2. To understand the degree to which recent variability and changes in the Arctic climate system, e.g., shrinking sea-ice cover, thawing permafrost and increased methane emission, are of natural or of anthropogenic origin. 
3. To understand and quantify the response of marine biological processes to climate change and their impact on Arctic marine ecosystems and the air-sea CO2 fluxes and to improve their representation in ecosystem models and inclusion in global climate models. 
4. To quantify the impact of the Arctic freshwater budget on the global thermohaline circulation (THC) and its impact on climate, and to assess possible impact on rapid climate change, sea-level change and sequestration of CO2. 
5. To improve capabilities to predict Arctic climate on decadal and longer time scales and design optimal components of an integrated monitoring and forecasting system. 
6. To assess the impact of climate change in the Arctic on the THC, marine ecosystems and fisheries, transportation, offshore industry and oil and gas production, coastal infrastructures, and on climate in Europe.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: AstroPoles
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=124

It has long been recognised that the polar plateaus provide the best sites on the Earth's surface for the conduct of a wide range of astronomical observations, from optical to millimetre wavelengths. This is on account of the extremely cold, dry and stable air found there. The exceptional site conditions would allow observations to be made of the cosmos, with greater sensitivity and clarity, and across a wider part of the electromagnetic spectrum, than from temperate-latitude sites. This IPY project aims to quantify these conditions at four sites, Summit in Greenland, Ellesmere Island in Canada, and Domes A and C on the Antarctic plateau, and then to begin the process of turning these sites into frontline observatories. Dome A is likely to be the pre-eminent location on the Earth for observational astronomy, but has only recently been visited by humans (China in 2005). Dome C is the site for a new station (France/Italy, fully operational in 2005), and already shows indications for better seeing conditions than for any existing observatory. Summit Station (Denmark/USA) and Ellesmere Island (Canada) are also extremely cold and dry. They are the best prospective observing sites in the northern polar regions and their conditions have not yet been quantified.

The project builds upon a decade of site testing experience, at both the South Pole and at Dome C, including the development of autonomous observatories that can gather the data over the winter. In particular, it will make use of AASTINOs (Automated Astrophysical Site Testing International Observatories) to conduct a range of experiments at each site, and to transmit the data to their operations centres via satellite phones. Measurements made will include the sky brightness (auroral in the optical, thermal emission in the infrared), the optical seeing and the transparency, precipitable water vapour content and microturbulence levels in the atmosphere, as well as the meteorological conditions. These will provide the baseline data needed to quantitatively assess what future astronomical facilities could be built in the polar regions, and the science programs they could tackle. The AASTINO's and their experimental suites will need to be brought to the four sites by overland traverse or by air transportation, with the scientists taken in by air to assemble them.

While the sites have not been fully characterised, it is already clear that the Antarctic plateau sites are superior to any existing observatories for a range of frontline experiments. This IPY project will also be used to instigate pathfinder experiments aimed at tackling fundamental problems in astrophysics, in particular to test enabling technologies that will make them possible. These experiments will, in turn, lead to the development of new frontline facilities beyond the IPY. The science program we would conduct with these facilities includes measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave radiation background resulting from the Big Bang, the use of optical and infrared telescopes to examine the formation of galaxies, sub-millimetre and terahertz frequency telescopes and interferometers to probe the dense molecular clouds where stars are born, the search for other earth-like planets in the Galaxy using interferometric and microlensing techniques, and the measurement of the earthshine from the Moon to probe the variations in the Earth's albedo, primarily resulting from changing cloud cover.

A critical design review of the project will be held during the SCAR meeting in Hobart in 2006. An international science meeting on Astronomy in the Polar Regions will also be organised for 2007, possibly in the UK or Greenland.

The specific aim of the Antarctic RiSCC programme was to understand the interactions between biodiversity, functioning and climate of Antarctic terrestrial and limnetic ecosystems, and to predict regional sensitivity to the impacts of climate change. This was to be achieved through gaining understanding of the differences in environments and biodiversity within and between ecosytems, potential for ecosystem processes to respond to changes in climate, and different effects of climate change on components of individual ecosytems.

RiSCC has now been superceeded by the SCAR programme Evolution and Biodiversity in Antarctica - the response of life to change (EBA).

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Cold Land Processes Field Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Cold Land Processes Field Experiment will focus on
developing the quantitative understanding, models, and
measurements necessary to extend our local-scale understanding
of water fluxes, storage, and transformations to regional and
global scales. The experiment will particularly emphasize
developing a strong synergism between process-oriented
understanding, land surface models and microwave remote sensing.

Microwave sensors appear ideal to measure properties of the
terrestrial cryosphere because the microwave signal is
sensitive to the dielectric constant of surface materials,
which in turn is sensitive to the phase of water, ice or liquid
[Koh, 1992]. Passive microwave sensors are sensitive to the
physical temperature of surface materials. Both active and
passive microwave sensors have demonstrated sensitivity to snow
properties and the freeze/thaw status of soils [Goodison and
Walker, 1993; Chang, et al., 1996; Shi and Dozier,
2000]. Microwave signal response is influenced by snow depth,
density, wetness, crystal size and shape, ice crusts and layer
structure, surface roughness, vegetation characteristics, soil
moisture, and soil freeze/thaw status [Davis et al., 1987; Hall
et al., 1986; McDonald and Ulaby, 1993; Josberger et al., 1996,
Kim, 1999; Rosenfeld and Grody, 2000]. While visible and
near-infrared sensors cannot see through clouds and require
adequate solar illumina!  tion, which is a frequent and severe
limitation in cold regions during winter [Cline and Carroll,
1999], measurements of the Earth surface in the microwave
spectral regions can be largely insensitive to weather
conditions and solar illumination. These properties make
microwave remote sensing attractive for providing spatially
distributed information to improve and update land-surface
models for cold regions, either through assimilation of
state-variable information estimated from microwave remote
sensing observations using inversion algorithms, or possibly
even through direct assimilation of microwave remote sensing
data themselves.

The specific objectives of the Cold Land Processes Field
Experiment are to:

1. Evaluate and improve snow water equivalent retrieval
algorithms for space-borne passive microwave sensors
(e.g. SSM/I and AMSR-E);

2. Evaluate and improve radar retrieval algorithms for snow
depth, density, and wetness, and soil freeze/thaw status;

3. Improve radar retrieval algorithms to enable discrimination
of freeze/thaw status of different surfaces (i.e. snow, soil,
and vegetation); Examine the effects of scale (spatial
resolution) on the skill of active and passive microwave remote
sensing retrieval algorithms for snow and freeze/thaw status;

4. Evaluate and improve spatially distributed, uncoupled
snow/soil models and coupled cold land surface schemes from
point scales to typical mesoscale grid-resolutions
(i.e. 25-km);

5. Examine the feasibility of coupling forward microwave
radiative-transfer schemes to spatially distributed snow/soil
models, to improve assimilation of microwave remote sensing
data;

6. Examine the spatial variability of snow and frozen soil
distributions in different environments and a) improve the
representation of subgrid-scale variability of snow and frozen
soil in coupled and uncoupled land surface models, and b)
improve the representation of orographic precipitation
(snowfall) in atmospheric models;

7. Examine methods of extending local-scale, process-oriented
equations describing important cold-land hydrologic and
boundary layer properties to larger scales typical of regional
and global atmospheric and hydrologic models.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Rural Oxident in a Southern Environment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An automated gas Chromatographic system was employed at a rural site in western central Alabama to measure atmospheric hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons (oxy-hydrocarbons) on an hourly basis from June 8 to July 19, 1990. The location, which was a designated site for the Southern Oxidant Study (SOS), was instrumented for a wide variety of measurements allowing the hydrocarbon and oxy-hydrocarbon measurements to be interpreted both in terms of meteorological data and as part of a large suite of gas phase measurements. Although the site is situated in a Loblolly pine plantation, isoprene was observed to be the dominant hydrocarbon during the daytime with afternoon maxima of about 7 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). Decrease of isoprene after sunset was too rapid to be accounted for solely on the basis of gas phase chemistry. During the nighttime, α-pinene and β-pinene were the dominant hydrocarbons of natural origin. The ratio of α-pinene to β-pinene showed a well-defined diurnal pattern, decreasing by more than 30% during the night; a decrease that could be understood on the basis of local gas phase chemistry. Oxy-hydrocarbons, dominated by methanol and acetone, were the most abundant compounds observed. On a carbon atom basis, the oxy-hydrocarbons contributed about 46% of the measured atmospheric burden during the daytime and about 40% at night. The similarity of the observed diurnal methanol variation to that of isoprene and subsequent measurements [McDonald and Fall, 1993] indicate that much of the observed methanol was of local biogenic origin. Correlation of acetone with methanol suggests that it, also, has a significant biogenic source. In spite of the site's rural location, anthropogenic hydrocarbons constituted, on a carbon atom basis, about 21% of the hydrocarbon burden measured during the daytime and about 55% at night. Significant diurnal variations of the anthropogenic hydrocarbons, with increases at night, appeared to be driven by the frequent formation of a shallow nocturnal boundary layer.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">The Canadian Antarctic Research Program</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An expectation of Canada’s full membership in SCAR is the development of a Canadian Antarctic research program. In its strategy document “Antarctic Science and Bipolar Linkages “ (CPC 2002) the Canadian Committee for Antarctic Research (CCAR) identified the creation of a Canadian Antarctic Research Program (CARP) as one of its highest priorities. In 2003 CCAR organised an international workshop (Polar Connections) to identify areas of Canadian scientific expertise that will form the basis of CARP. During IPY, polar science will be in the national and international spotlight and it will be an ideal time for Canada to launch CARP. A Canadian Antarctic Research Program will provide support for Canadian research activities in Antarctica and will compliment traditional sources of research funding (NSERC, SSHRC, CIHR).

Canadian scientists have conducted research in Antarctica for decades, but in the absence of a national program Canadians participate as part of national programs of other countries. CARP will allow Canadians to design and lead their own research projects and participate in or even lead international projects. Canada does not intend to build a research base in Antarctica but through CARP Canadian researchers will buy space and support from other countries.

At the heart of CARP is a science program emphasising (but not limited to) three scientific themes where Canadian researchers are already active:
Theme 1, Contaminants, biota and polar microbial ecosystems,
Theme 2, Ice observations, ice sheet dynamics and environmental change,
Theme 3, Polar desert landscape ecology and geomorphology.
The research team involved in contaminants, biota and polar microbial ecosystems is the most advanced in its research planning with Antarctic partnerships and active field programs with France, UK, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. Contaminants in polar environments are a serious problem and are an area of science where Canada is a recognised world leader. This research is truly bipolar in nature and has tremendous value for the people of northern Canada. Canadian researchers and technologies also have international recognition in the area of ice observations and environmental change. For example RADARSAT is one of the most widely used remote sensing platforms in the analysis of Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelf dynamics. Several Canadians are involved in ongoing ice research in both Polar Regions as well as ice sheet modelling, reconstruction and neotectonics. This research will compliment activities in the Canadian Arctic that is included in several other IPY proposals. Research activities in various aspects of Antarctic landscape ecology; geomorphology and paleoenvironmental reconstruction is underway by several Canadian researchers in partnership with New Zealand, Italy, USA, UK and Bulgaria. The main focus of this theme will be an investigation of landscape relationships along an environmental gradient in the McMurdo Dry Valleys region. Research outside of these theme areas will also need to be supported by CARP. Data management is also a key component of CARP and plans include the use of innovative GIS tools developed by Canadian researchers involved in the Cybercartographic Atlas of Antarctica.

CARP will provide the basis for a co-ordinated program of Canadian Antarctic research. CARP will serve as a focus for Canadian Antarctic research, working with relevant agencies and organisations to articulate science objectives that reflect Canada’s need for information about Antarctica. CARP provides a vehicle for grouping all Canadian IPY proposals with bipolar and antarctic activities.

The Earth’s Polar Regions drive many global systems and with uncertainties about global climate change looming large the need for information about both Polar Regions has never been greater. As a polar nation Canada needs to be concerned with both the Arctic and the Antarctic as part of the global system.

No instrument like MISR has flown in space before. Viewing the sunlit
Earth simultaneously at nine widely spaced angles, MISR provides

MISR provides new types of information for scientists studying Earth's
climate, such as the partitioning of energy and carbon between the
land surface and the atmosphere, and the regional and global impacts
of different types of atmospheric particles and clouds on climate. The
change in reflection at different view angles affords the means to
distinguish different types of atmospheric particles (aerosols), cloud

this enables construction of 3-D models and estimation of the total

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Sea Ice Mass Balance in the Antarctic-SIMBA Drift Station</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This project was the International Polar Year sea ice drift station for Antarctic Sea Ice, a component of the overall project, Antarctic Sea Ice, endorsed internationally by the Joint Committee for IPY (www.ipy.org). Additionally, the buoys deployed were endorsed as an IPY contribution to the WCRP/SCAR International Programme on Antarctic Buoys (IPAB). The major goals of this study were to investigate the evolution of the sea ice cover in the Bellingshausen−Amundsen−Ross Seas during the late winter−summer periods. A ship−based study (NB Palmer) conducted in the Bellingshausen Sea focused on the first half of the period when the net radiation balance was still negative (Sept−Oct). The ship studies, including transit sampling stations and a drifting station were extended to include the remaining evolution of the ice cover into early summer using autonomous mass balance buoys and high temporal motion buoys, and complementary satellite measurements from the ICES at laser altimeter, RadarSAT SAR, and AMSR-E passive microwave instruments.

Work from the NB Palmer was a drifting station tied to an ice floe for 27 days in the Bellingshausen Sea during a 60 day cruise, Sept−Oct 2007. During the cruise and on the ice station, on−ice measurements were conducted on sea ice physical, biological and biogeochemical properties. The ice station work included time series measurements of these properties at two sites over the period of ice station occupation. CTD and trace metal casts were conducted in transit and at the ice station. Drifting ice mass balance buoys measuring snow and ice thickness changes, ice temperatures, CTD, and under ice spectral irradiance were deployed at the ice station site and continued to transmit autonomously for up to six weeks after the ice station work until early Dec 2007. At the ice station site, and also in transit to and from the main floe ice, surveys of snow and ice physical properties were conducted. The surveys consisted of horizontal transects measuring at intervals snow depth, ice thickness and the areal extent and thickness of flooded layers observed at the snow ice interface. Line measurements were repeated three times during the twenty seven day ice station period to determine changes in snow and ice properties and thickness. Swath bathymetry of the ocean bottom during drift station and transit was obtained and ADCP profiles were continuously recorded throughout the drift station and during transit. 

Two other activities were conducted under the auspices of the SIMBA project.

Oden Cruise 2006-summer ice conditions. This first cruise of the Oden to McMurdo Sound in 2006 consisted of underway ice observations by this project of summer ice conditions across the Ross Sea during the transit. These observations were then used to validate AMSR-E passive microwave estimates of sea ice extent and concentration along the cruise track, other comparisons were made with satellite-based ice mapping of sea ice extent conducted by the National Ice Center during the period of the cruise.

Deployment of Ice Mass Balance buoy- Summer-Fall Transition in the Amundsen Sea One Ice Mass Balance buoy (IMB) that had been deployed during the drift phase of SIMBA in Oct 2007 and recovered at the end of the drift deployment was redeployed during the NB Palmer cruise to the Amundsen Sea in Jan-Feb 09.This buoy provided ice temperature, CTD, and ice and snow thickness information for seven weeks, from late summer-fall, contrasting with the spring-summer transition observed from the buoys deployed on the SIMBA drift station in 2007.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=58

We will mount a series of research expeditions during IPY to Nordaustlandet, Svalbard, the northernmost island in the Nordic Arctic sector which is 90% ice covered. The multi-disciplinal and multi-national initiative is composed by 26 projects, having individual goals, but well integrated common themes (http://www.eld.geo.uu.se/IPY/projects). The spectrum of projects from geosciences to the humanities, investigates how the environmental and anthropogenic dynamics have changed recently in comparison with past records of change from existing expedition logs and photographs, proxy climate data from ice-, lake- and sea-sediment cores, and dynamic studies both on terrestrial as marine ice, comprising more than 80 Principal Investigators (www.eld.geo.uu.se/IPY/personnel). 

We will monitor atmospheric, terrestrial and cryospheric chemical, and physical fluxes continuously over, and beyond, the period of the IPY. The activities will be integrated to existing research and monitoring in Svalbard as well as to relevant IPY projects to which Kinnvika base will serve an important add on site.Historical remains in the field and in archives from a succession of cultures of whale hunting, trapping, exploration and mineral exploitation are abundant on Nordaustlandet and northwestern Spitsbergen. Economic change and cultural variability are major themes in the interdisciplinary humanistic research that will investigate these traces at significant sites, esp. natural harbors located at good hunting grounds of the past. Historical archaeology, including pioneering arctic marine archaeology, will be combined with scientific investigations of e.g. soil chemistry, erosion and local biological alterations resulting from human interaction with the wilderness of Spitsbergen. History of science will be a major integrating endeavor in this, relating a temporal and geographical sequence of aboriginal and Western knowledge projects to the crucial transition from colonial to post-colonial arctic science and scholarship.Earlier research expedition data viewed through modern surveys and data gathering will provide data on the degree of change and variability in this particular system. Proxy-records from a variety of natural archives will bring a time-dimension to more process-focused or monitoring studies. Special attention will be paid to the response of the cryosphere to past climate and environmental changes. This is closely linked to geological assessment of glacial history and monitoring of atmospheric pollutant transport pathways. Advanced statistical methods and numerical models will be used to elucidate linkages between the systems and global teleconnections. In addition the biological legacy of the 1957-58 IGY will be explored via investigation of anthropogenically disturbed vegetation, soils, and soil biology (invertebrates, microbes) to determine the persistence of human influence on semi-desert ecosystems. We aim to provide a platform for broadband scientific endeavour into a relatively poorly investigated part of the Svalbard Archipelago. The plethora of instruments and methods we plan to unleash are required to fully measure change and variability in the Arctic system both from the human use to the resonances within the natural system. For synergies sought between different research fields, see (www.eld.geo.uu.se/IPY/synergies).We will provide a legacy in the form of a renovated scientific base for future, primarily Nordic field research on Nordaustlandet

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">First results obtained with the meso scale model METRAS show that small scale variations of the sea ice concentration can significantly influence the large scale transports of momentum, heat, and humidity. This concerns the surface fluxes and the vertical profiles of the fluxes in the atmospheric boundary layer. Based on these results and on airborne and ship based measurements (campaigns REFLEX, ARTIST, and ACSYS) improved parameterizations of fluxes over sea ice covered areas will be developed and tested. The influence of an inhomogenous sea ice concentration on the large scale transports of energy and humidity as well as the scale dependence of parameterizations will be further analyzed. 
Another goal is the study of cloud formation over ice covered areas.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

information about the absorption of solar radiation by clouds and the
relative roles of cirrus cloud radiative effects and surface
evaporation in limiting maximum sea surface temperatures in the
equatorial Pacific. This large, interdisciplinary experiment,

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=152

One of the most extreme environments on the surface of Earth is the ice divide that crosses the inner part of East Antarctica. Along this ice divide, Earth's oldest layered ice, long-isolated subglacial lakes, and important earth crustal structures are located. Antarctic mass balance is the most significant gap in determining the current role of the cryosphere on the present and future contribution of land ice to sea level change. Despite past international efforts, most of the East Antarctic ice sheet is still unexplored and its subglacial geologic setting is completely unknown. East Antarctic ice cores provide the longest records of climate and atmospheric parameters but we still have an imperfect understanding of the means by which the signals of regional and global climate variability reach the coring sites and are locked into the ice records. 
Only through a concerted international effort will it be possible to access the interior of East Antarctica with sufficient logistic support for on ground cutting edge research in the hitherto almost totally unexplored regions and to link coastal sites with the interior.
Several countries, under the auspices of SCAR and COMNAP have extensive experience undertaking ambitious scientific traverse programs in Antarctica. Twenty SCAR countries have been involved in the SCAR-IGBP ITASE traverse program during the last 10 years. TASTE-IDEA project represents the IPY evolution of this very successful programme. The traverses, coupled with airplane support, operate effectively as a polar research vessel, and offer ground-based platforms for multidisciplinary research coupled with the most modern technology. 
The International Polar Year Trans-Antarctic Scientific Traverses objectives and main goals are to:
- Obtain a new set of ice cores to extend the record of climate variability in the past on time-scales from years to millennia to integrate the short duration and lacking in instrumental record.
- Survey of inner and coastal unexplored part of the continent by means of geophysical measurements, shallow drillings and remote sensing techniques.
- Obtain a chronological linkage between the main deep ice drill sites in East Antarctica and survey the present-day variability in climate-meteorological condition.
- Study how the signals of regional and global climate variability reach the coring sites and are locked into the ice record through the load and composition of atmospheric aerosol and gases and the processes occurring at the atmosphere/snow interface
- Study the effect of the ice divide on the present climatic conditions and determine the past variations of ice divide and dome location.
- Obtain geophysical and glaciological surveys required to identify the location of the longest coherent climate record in Antarctic ice.
- Provide new information for surface mass balance and ice sheet elevation change.
- Survey the ice dynamics and geologic setting of important earth crustal structures of East Antarctica Precambrian craton and at subglacial lake site.
- Deploy permanent and/or semi-permanent instruments in inaccessible regions for exploring Planet Earth and beyond.
- Revisit areas and sites first explored during IGY traverses to observe possible changes.
In order to achieve optimal results the scientific efforts along the individual traverse legs must be well coordinated, with a clear overall science plan and time frames for e.g. meteorological observations or upper air soundings.

      NASA relies on the science community to identify and prioritize leading-edge scientific questions and the observations required to answer them. One principal means by which NASA’s Science Mission Directorate engages the science community in this task is through the National Research Council (NRC). The NRC conducts studies that provide a science community consensus on key questions posed by NASA and other U.S. Government agencies. The broadest of these studies in NASA’s areas of research are decadal surveys. As the name implies, NASA and its partners ask the NRC once each decade to look out ten or more years into the future and prioritize research areas, observations, and notional missions to make those observations. 
       The NRC completed its first decadal survey for Earth science, Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond (NRC, 2007) in January 2007 at the request of NASA, NOAA, and USGS. [At this URL, click on “Sign In” to download a free pdf of the report.] At the highest level, the report recommends that: “The U.S. government, working in concert with the private sector, academe, the public, and its international partners, should renew its investment in Earth-observing systems and restore its leadership in Earth science and applications.”
      
      Detailed recommendations in the decadal survey are provided in three categories:
      
      - Setting the Foundation: Observations in the Current Decade
      - New Observations for the Next Decade
      - Turning Satellite Observations into Knowledge and Information
      
      For the next decade, the decadal survey identified 15 new space missions for NASA (including 1 joint mission with NOAA) and 3 missions for NOAA (including the 1 joint mission). The 15 missions for NASA are presented in three time-phased blocks. Importantly, the 17 missions are presented as the result of a “prioritization methodology designed to achieve a robust, integrated program”(pg. 7) and the “missions listed…form a minimal, yet robust, observational component of an Earth information system that is capable of addressing a broad range of societal needs.” (pg. 8)

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The construction of four seafloor recording magnetometers, to the Flinders University design, was completed during February 1996, and the instruments transported to Hobart. In April they were taken on the Antarctic Vessel Aurora Australis (Voyage 6 of 1995-96) and deployed from the ship at sites Bruny (48 42&amp;#039; S, 144 44&amp;#039; E), Huon (49 49&amp;#039; S, 144 19&amp;#039; E), Rossel (50 38&amp;#039; S, 143 49&amp;#039; E) and Girardin (51 45&amp;#039; S, 143 17&amp;#039; E). In deployment, the instruments were placed to investigate the conductivity structure of the Southern Ocean Spreading Ridge (Figure 13). The magnetometers will be deployed on the floor of the Southern Ocean for a year, and time for their recovery is scheduled for Voyage 6 (1996-97) of the Aurora Australis, to take place in March 1997. 

The region is also a place of concentration of the Antarctic Circum-polar Current (ACC). An important reason for the timing of SOMEx is to record simultaneously with a major international oceanographic experiment in the ACC, for which a deployment of instruments took place in March 1995, and which will run for two years. It is expected that there will be benefits from an exchange of data between the ACC experiment and SOMEx. The ACC experiment is part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). 

SOMEx is a collaborative study between the Australian National University and Flinders University of South Australia.

Los Alamos National Laboratory is collaborating on a new tool that will provide public health officials with an early warning and response system for threats to public health.

The threat to public health from infectious diseases is increasing. New, evolving and emerging diseases have appeared in unexpected locations with increasing regularity as society becomes more mobile. Diseases such as HIV, dengue fever and hantavirus present unique and significant challenges to the public health infrastructure, both in recognizing their presence and dealing with their effects. The familiar flu virus takes a significant toll every year, causing thousands of deaths, mostly among the aged or the young.

The threat of bioterrorism also has increased. A rogue group could introduce virulent biological pathogens into a popula- tion with potentially catastrophic results, if we do not have the tools to detect and respond. Most flu epidemics are recognized only after they happen, and therefore, appropriate medical attention is often too late.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: CASO
Project URL: http://www.clivar.org/organization/southern/CASO/
Proposal URL:http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=132

CASO provides an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the role of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in past, present and future climate during the IPY 2007-2008 (see http://www.clivar.org/organization/southern/documents/SOIPY.pdf for a more complete description of the CASO science plan). 

CASO is organised into five themes: 
1. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in the global water cycle 
2. Southern hemisphere teleconnections
3. Climate processes at the Antarctic continental margin
4. Climate ecosystem biogeochemistry interactions in the Southern Ocean 
5. Records of past Antarctic climate variability and change 

This proposal describes IPY activities grouped in the Antarctic Ocean Circulation cluster of EOIs that contribute to the goals of CASO.

Objectives:
1. To obtain a synoptic circumpolar snapshot of the physical environment of the Southern Ocean (collaboration with other IPY activities will extend the snapshot to include biogeochemistry, ecology, and biodiversity).
2. To enhance understanding of the role of the Southern Ocean in past, present and future climate, including connections between the zonal and meridional circulation of the Southern Ocean, water mass transformation, atmospheric variability, ocean-cryosphere interactions, physical-biogeochemical-ecological linkages, and teleconnections between polar and lower latitudes.

Outcomes/Deliverables:
1. Improved climate predictions, from models that incorporate a better understanding of southern polar processes.
2. Proof of concept of a viable, cost-effective, sustained observing system for the southern polar regions (including ocean, atmosphere and cryosphere).
3. A baseline for the assessment of future change.

Major field programs:
1. A circumpolar array of full-depth multi-disciplinary hydrographic sections and XBT/XCTD sections, extending from the Antarctic continent northward across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, including key water mass formation regions (EOIs 109, 173, 225 284, 599, 730, 770, 806, 924, 51, 350, 283, 584, 911, 271, 440, 596).
2. An enhanced circumpolar array of sea ice drifters, measuring a range of ice, ocean and atmosphere parameters (108, 109, 51).
3. Profiling floats deployed throughout the Southern Ocean, including acoustically-tracked floats in ice-covered areas (109, 180, 599, 485, 596).
4. Current meter moorings to provide time series of ocean currents and water mass properties at key passages, in centres of action of dominant modes of variability, and in areas of bottom water formation and export (109, 173, 225, 599, 604, 806, 51, 596).
5. Environmental sensors deployed on marine mammals (77, 596).
6. Direct measurements of diapycnal and isopycnal mixing rates in the Southern Ocean (183).
7. Analysis of ice cores, sediment cores and deep corals to extend observations of Southern Ocean variability back beyond the instrumental era (109, 806, 51).
8. Bottom pressure gauges will be used near Drake Passage to monitor ocean currents, validate tidal models, and improve regional corrections to satellite altimeter products (567, 580).
9. Automatic weather stations, flux measurements in the boundary layer and drifters to measure atmospheric variability (pressure, winds, heat and freshwater flux) (108, 109). 

The observations will be integrated closely with modelling studies using a variety of approaches (coupled climate models; high resolution ocean-ice models; atmospheric models; tidal models; Lagrangian diagnostics; 320, 284, 567, 580, 590,117).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general circulation models (GCMs). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems and the ... radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 - July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (July 1 - July 28, 1992). Each mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical processes of the cloud systems.

These data were collected during the FIRE Marine Stratocumulus experiment on San Nicolas Island, California. They are as follows: cloud base height data measured with a ceilometer; processed CLASS sounding (CSD) data up to 2 kilometers (thermodynamic data only), raw CSD recorded at 3.3 second intervals (thermodynamic data only), and raw CSD at 10 second intervals (thermodynamic and wind data).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Aerosol Research Branch (ARB) Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)
project has been taking ground based LIDAR measurements from Langley
Research Center in Hampton, Virginia since May 1974.  These LIDAR
measurements provide high resolution vertical profiles of the upper
tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols. The LIDAR system has evolved
over the years and provides a valuable long-term history of the
middle-latitude stratospheric aerosol.
Project Description:
The measurements for ARB were made using a LIDAR system.  This system
uses a ruby laser that emits one joule per pulse with a repeat rate of
0.15 hertz (Hz) at a wavelength of 0.6943 micrometers.  This system
also uses a 48 inch cassegrainian configured telescope mounted on a
movable platform.  The transmitter laser beam has a divergence of
about 1.0 mrad, and the maximum receiver field of view is 4.0 mrad.
The LIDAR has a signal bandwidth of 1 MHz, and this is equal to a 150
meter vertical resolution.  Three photomultiplier tubes are used to
enhance the dynamic range.  These tubes are electronically switched on
at specific times after the laser has been fired.  The photomultiplier
tube output signals are processed by 12-bit Computer Automated
Measurement and Control (CAMAC) based digitizers and acquired by a
personal computer.
Data Used and Produced:
The Aerosol Research Branch (ARB) 48-inch LIDAR (ARB_48_IN_LIDAR) data
set contains data collected from a 48-inch LIDAR system located at
NASA Langley Research Center.  Each granule consists of one year of
data.  Data are available from 1982 through the present.  Data are
continuously being collected.  The days of data are different in each
granule.  Each measurement consists of four parameters: stratospheric
integrated backscatter from tropopause to 30 km, altitude levels,
scattering ratio at each altitude level, and aerosol backscattering
coefficient at each altitude level.  An image has been produced to
represent the data collected for each granule.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Antarctic Peninsula is the largest of ~ twelve micro-continental fragments between southern South America, East Antarctica, and New Zealand. Their original positions and movement history following Gondwana breakup are poorly constrained. Recent work on the Antarctic Peninsula fore-arc/arc/back-arc suggests it consists of two suspect terranes that originated elsewhere and collided with the Pacific margin of Gondwana in the Cretaceous. This study reviews provenance models for three laterally extensive, kilometers-thick sedimentary units in the Antarctic Peninsula using previous studies, and new sandstone detrital modes and chemistry. 1) The Trinity Peninsula Group accretionary complex (Triassic) was possibly derived from a glaciated continental margin and may consist of several accreted tracts.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">ARCTIC OCEAN WARMING IN THE PAST</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The overall goal of this initiative is to advance our knowledge of climate warming in the Arctic, by studying past climate change. We will focus mainly on the ocean circulation and climate of the NW Eurasian continental margin. The present climate in the Arctic shows signs of rapid change with decreasing sea ice cover and increasing temperature of the Atlantic Water. The implications of this warming are highly uncertain, as modelling experiments projecting temperatures for the next 100 years show a largescatter at high northern latitudes.
The project will include the following modules (M): M1 Rapid changes in the Atlantic Water inflow into the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, M2 Ice sheet/glacier response to warming, M3 Improving ocean temperature and sea-ice proxies; M4 Climate modelling.

M1: Periods in the past during which the climate was instable and reached warmer conditions than today: a) Marine isotope stages (MIS) 12/11; b) MIS 6/5; c) Younger Dryas/Holocene climate optimum, and d) last millennium. Sea Surface Temperature ( SST) will be quantified using a multidisciplinary approach, combining faunal/floral based transfer functions and geochemical tracers. For the Holocene and the last millennium climate will be investigated in marine sediments, lake sediments and ice cores from Svalbard and marine sediments from the SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland margin. Further, archaeological sites in Norway and Svalbard will be investigated to explore the relationship between climate and human settlement and activities.
M2: Implications of climate warming for growth and decay of ice sheets and tide water glaciers, and its effect on ice stream dynamics in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard and SE Greenland margin.
M3: Reconstructions of SST below 5 OC based both on transfer functions and geochemical tracers are subject to large uncertainties. This is partly due to incomplete modern training sets at high latitudes. We aim to improve modern analogue data on planktonic and benthic foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, foraminiferal Ca/Mg-ratios and oxygen and carbon isotopes. From the same proxies we will also develop transfer functions for sea ice.
M4: An important motivation for attempting to simulate the climatic conditions of the past is that such experiments provide opportunities for evaluating how models respond to large changes in forcing.
Combined with high resolution acoustic data, cores will be sampled from high resolution sediment fans off northern and western Spitsbergen, the Spitsbergen fjords (in particular Kongsfjorden) and the Barents/Kara/Laptev Sea margin. Multi-core/box core surface samples &gt;70ON in the NE Atlantic will be sampled. The SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland component will rely on existing seafloor samples. The project will include exchange programs and training courses for PhD students and young researchers.
This expression of intent focus on research questions addressed by IGP-PAGES and CLIVAR.

It is possible to discover in the bottom of ponds known as fronts or mountainous areas of sediment that could reveal hidden hydrocarbons. Awareness precise fracture zones may be useful in geothermal exploration and assessment of earthquake risk. The program also works to improving the means geophysical implemented, both on the field and the processing of data.

evolution.  The primary role of the T-28 was to penetrate upper
regions of convective clouds following the dispersal of sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6), radar chaff, and/or fluorescent beads in
lower regions of the cloud. Instrumentation on-board recorded
SF6 levels, as well as collecting data on the hydrometeor
spectrum from micrometer-sized cloud droplets to

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Meltpond2000 is the first in a series of Arctic and Antarctic aircraft campaigns planned as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua sea ice validation program for the EOS Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). This prelaunch Arctic field campaign was carried out between June 25 and July 6, 2000 from Thule, Greenland with the objective of quantifying the errors incurred by the AMSR-E sea ice algorithms resulting from the presence of melt ponds. A secondary objective of the mission was to develop a microwave capability to discriminate between melt ponds and seawater using low-frequency microwave radiometers. Meltpond2000 was a multiagency effort involving personnel from the Navy, NOAA, and NASA. The field component of the mission consisted of making five 8-hour flights from Thule Air Base, Greenland with a Naval Air Warfare Center P-3 aircraft over portions of Baffin Bay and the Canadian Arctic. The aircraft sensors were provided and operated by the Microwave Radiometry Group of NOAA's Environmental Technology Laboratory. A Navy ice observer with the National Ice Center provided visual documentation of surface ice conditions during each of the flights. Two of the five flights were coordinated with Canadian scientists making surface measurements of melt ponds at an ice camp located near Resolute Bay, Canada. Coordination with the Canadians will provide additional information on surface characteristics and will be of great value in the interpretation of the aircraft and high-resolution satellite data sets.

The Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2), initiated in 1988, was the
first project funded under the Arctic System Science (ARCSS)
program. Studies of the GISP2 ice cores and companion European cores
(the GReenland Ice core Project, or GRIP, cores) ushered in a new era
of continuous, high-resolution, multi-parameter paleoenvironmental
investigation.

The GISP2 cores offered a high-resolution archive of more than 110,000
years of global change history, including at least the last
interglacial-to-glacial cycle. They provide the longest such record
available from the Northern Hemisphere. Scientists studying the GISP2
cores analyzed ice stratigraphy, trapped gases and their stable
isotopes, stable isotopes in ice, particulates, major and trace
element chemistry of ice, ice conductivity, and physical properties of
the cores. The detailed paleoenvironmental history revealed by GISP2
research has greatly expanded our understanding of global change and
earth system science.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Global Historical Climatology Network</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) is a comprehensive global
surface baseline climate data set designed to be used to monitor and detect
climate change. Comprised of surface station observations of temperature,
precipitation, and pressure, all GHCN data are on a monthly basis. GHCN is
produced jointly by the National Climatic Data Center, Arizona State
University, and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. GHCN version 1 was released in August of 1992 and has data
from ~6,000 Temperature stations ~7,500 Precipitation stations ~2,000 Pressure
stations The earliest station data is from 1697. The most recent from 1990. It
was created from 15 source data sets. Quality Control included visual
inspection of graphs of all station time series, tests for precipitation
digitized 6 months out of phase, tests for different stations having identical
data, and other tests.

GHCN version 2 is currently being created. A beta release of precipitation
datawas made in April 1998 (the most recent data of which is from 1996) and the
full version 2 temperature data was released in 1997. Version 2 has significant
improvements over version

1: more data (e.g., the precipitation data set has data from over 20,000
stations) from more sources (over 30 different sources including the Colonial
Era Archive Project contributed to version 2), more elements (mean monthly
maximum and minimum temperature data as well as mean temperature), better
Quality Control, homogeneity adjustments, and a wider selection of metadata.
Version 2 will also be regularly updated and irregularly have data from
additional stations added to the data set. Therefore, with the release of GHCN
version 2 temperature data, we have removed GHCN version 1 temperature data
from our anonymous ftp site. There are many unique features in GHCN version

2. For example, we have determined many cases where different sources have
provided us with different mean temperature time series for the same station.
Because meteorologists calculate daily mean temperature many different ways,
there can be many different "correct" mean temperatures. Therefore, for many
stations, GHCN provides more than one mean temperature time series. Also, GHCN
version 2 has some unique and potentially very useful station metadata such as
population and vegetation indicators. To understand GHCN version 2 temperature
data and metadata, please read our overview of it. In addition to this
overview, we have another document on line that describes GHCN's Quality
Control.

In SOS, these groups work to design and execute scientific research and assessment programs that will increase understanding of the accumulation of ozone, other oxidants, and fine particulate matter in the atmosphere near the ground.  The SOS program began in 1988 and will continue at least through the year 2002.
            
SOS was formed in June 1988 when a group of 60 concerned scientists, federal and state agency officials and key industrial representatives gathered at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA.  The group posed the question of why ozone reduction measures had been unsuccessful, particularly in the South.  As a result, the following actions took place:
            
Establishment of a multi-year research and monitoring program to study the formation of ozone in the South and to evaluate alternative strategies for its reduction.             
      
Creation of the Southern Oxidants Study, a strategic alliance committed to supporting and participating in the program.

The SeaWinds scatterometer is a specialized microwave radar that
measures near-surface wind velocity (both speed and direction) under
all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans. This is a twin
sister to the QuikSCAT sensor and it was launched onboard the Japanese
ADEOS-II Spacecraft on December 14, 2002 to provide similar
observations beyond the QuikSCAT mission. The experiment is a
follow-on mission and continues the data series initiated in 1996 by
the NSCAT.

SeaWinds is a part of the Earth Observing System (EOS) which is
designed to address global environmental changes, and is a joint
mission with the National Space Development Agency of Japan
(NASDA). Winds are a critical factor in determining regional weather
patterns and climate. Oceans cover 70 percent of Earth's surface, and
as the only remote-sensing system to provide accurate, frequent,
high-resolution measurements of ocean surface wind velocities, under
all weather conditions, scatterometers play an increasingly important
role in oceanographic, meteorological and climate studies.

As part of the SeaWinds Project, NASA sponsors a team of scientific
investigators who advised the project during the development of the
instrument and ground data processing system. The science team will
conduct research with SeaWinds data; their studies are expected to
lead to improved methods of global weather forecasting and modeling.

The SeaWinds Project is managed for NASA's Earth Science Enterprise by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute
of Technology.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Second Aerosol Characterization Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The second Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-2) took
place from 16 June till 24 July, 1997, over the sub-tropical
North-East Atlantic.

The choice of the area and time period was based on the
following considerations. The area is characterized by large
scale subsidence and therefore by the existence of a distinct
temperature inversion separating the marine boundary layer
(MBL) from the free troposphere FT. Earlier observations
(ASTEX, Prospero, Raes, ?) have shown that in he MBL of the
N.E. Atlantic clean air alternates with anthropogenic pollution
from Europe and possibly from N. America (ASTEX, McGovern, see
discussion below). In the FT aloft, clean air masses alternate
with mineral dust transported out of N. Africa (Propspero,
Raes). The area thus offers opportunities for studying the
characteristics of various aerosol types. Furthermore, the
dynamics of the MBL in this area are reasonably well understood
(ASTEX) so that Lagrangian experiments could be planned
focusing on aerosol processing during transport over the
ocean. In addition, the area offers good opportunities to study
the interaction of aerosol!  s with the low level MBL
stratiform clouds.

Objectives:

1. Determine the physical, chemical, radiative and cloud
nucleating properties of the major aerosol types in the North
Atlantic region and investigate the relationships between these
properties.

2. Quantify the physical and chemical processes controlling the
evolution of the major aerosol types and in particular their
physical, chemical, radiative and cloud nucleating processes.

3. Develop procedures to extrapolate aerosol properties and
processes from the local to regional and global scale, and
assess the regional direct and indirect radiative forcing by
aerosols in the North Atlantic region.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Substantiation of Activity
Protected natural areas (PAS) are national patrimony objects. PAS are very important in nature conservation, especially in preservation of environmental standards and plant and animal gene pools, and in maintenance of ecological balance. PAS are conductive to renewal of natural resources and improve the quality of human environment.
The importance of ecological monitoring in the Arctic and Subarctic zones within the framework of the International Polar Year is due to a low level of stability of the Arctic, Subarctic and northern Taiga ecosystems under the pressure of anthropogenic load and, consequently, their high vulnerability.
Complex ecological research is planned on the territory of the reserves heavily affected by pollution: the Kostomukshskii and the Pasvik state nature reserves. The Kostomukshskii reserve is situated in the north-eastern Karelia, near the border with Finland. In 1990, a Russian-Finnish reserve “Druzhba” (“Friendship”) was founded, represented by the Kostomukshskii reserve on the Russian side and by five isolated PAS on the Finnish side. An ore mining and processing enterprise (OMPE) is situated very close to the reserve, emitting into the atmosphere up to 60-70 thousand tons of pollutants annually, including up to 50 thousand tons of sulphur dioxide. The Pasvik reserve is situated in the Pechanga district of the Murmansk region, in the River Pas catchment area, near the border with Norway. An OMPE “Pechanganikel’” is situated at a distance of 15 kilometres from the reserve, emitting into the atmosphere up to 260 thousand tons of sulphur dioxide, 300 tons of nickel and 230 tons of copper annually.

Main research objectives
Development and implementation of a program of complex PAS monitoring, for development of rational schemes of nature protection and management in PAS.
Development and implementation of an IAS on PAS of the Russian Polar Zone on the basis of GIS technologies, for support of management decisions.
Ecological education and increasing public awareness of PAS as a mechanism of wildlife conservation.

Research stages
Stage 1. Collection of information available in the library stocks and its analytical review.
Stage 2. Creation of a set of basic digital cartographic materials on the territories in question, development and substantiation of information system structure and composition of information resources.
Stage 3. Complex field research at the pilot objects, including eco-geochemical testing and other specialised investigations.
Stage 4. Chemical-analytical investigations.
Stage 5. Office studies of the materials collected and the incoming analytical data. Compilation of the factual information bank.
Stage 6. Development of a programme of complex monitoring (involving climate, eco-geochemical, landscape and biocenological, social and ethnographic factors, economic activity, management, etc.).
Stage 7. Elaboration and implementation of an IAS of PAS, loaded with data on specific objects.
Stage 8. PAS popularisation by means of development of a web-site “Polar Zone PAS”, reports and publications.

The READER Project

READER (REference Antarctic Data for Environmental Research) is a
project of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR
http://www.scar.org/) and has the goal of creating a high quality,
long term dataset of mean surface and upper air meteorological
measurements from in-situ Antarctic observing systems. These data will
be of value in climate research and climate change investigations.

The primary sources of data are the Antarctic research stations and
automatic weather stations. Data from mobile platforms, such as ships
and drifting buoys are not being collected since our goal is to derive
time series of data at fixed locations.

Surface and upper air data are being collected and the principal
statistics derived are monthly and annual means. Daily data will not
be provided in order to keep the data set to a manageable size. With
the resources available to the project, it is clearly not possible to
collect all the information that could be required by the whole range
of investigations into change in the Antarctic. Instead a key set of
meteorological variables (surface temperature, mean sea level pressure
and surface wind speed, and upper air temperature, geopotential height
and wind speed at standard levels) are being assembled and a
definitive set of measurements presented for use by researchers.

A lot of stations have been operated in the Antarctic over the years;
many for quite short periods. However, our goal here is to provide
information on the long time series that can provide insight into
change in the Antarctic. So to be included, the record from a station
must extend for 25 years, although not necessarily in a continuous
period, or be currently in operation and have operated for the last 10
years. In READER we have chosen to use only data from year-round
stations.

It is important when using mean data to know the number of
observations that were used in computing the means. As discussed in
the data section, the READER mean monthly values are therefore colour
coded to indicate the percentage of possible observations used in
computing each mean.

Metadata are being provided, where possible, to indicate the type of
observing systems used to make the measurements, changes of observing
site, changes of observing practice etc. The structure of the metadata
is deliberately flexible and will vary considerable between stations,
depending on what information is available.

The READER data set is being disseminated via CD-ROM and through the
World Wide Web at
http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/programs-hosted.html. The first
release of the data set covers the period up to the end of 2000 and
contains all the data collected so far. However, there are still a
number of significant gaps and it is hoped that these can be filled
over the coming years. In particular, we still require more upper air
data.

The data set will be kept up to date on a regular basis via the web
site and new versions of the CD released periodically.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      This SCAR programme Evolution and Biodiversity in the Antarctic (EBA) seeks to:
      1. Understand the evolution and diversity of life in the Antarctic;
      2. Determine how these have influenced the properties and dynamics of present
      Antarctic ecosystems and the Southern Ocean system;
      3. Make predictions on how organisms and communities are responding and will
      respond to current and future environmental change; and
      4. Identify EBA science outcomes that are relevant to conservation policy and
      to communicate this science to the SCAR Antarctic Treat System via the SCAR
      Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.
      
      EBA is structured in five research strands or work packages, each representing
      marine and terrestrial/freshwater ecosystems:
      
      Work Package 1: Evolutionary history of Antarctic organisms
      Work Package 2: Evolutionary adaptation to the Antarctic environment
      Work Package 3: Patterns of gene flow within, into and out of the Antarctic,
      and consequences for population dynamics: isolation as a driving force
      Work Package 4: Patterns and diversity of organisms, ecosystems and habitats in
      the Antarctic, and controlling processes
      Work Package 5: Impact of past, current and predicted future environmental

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Deepwater Program: Northern Gulf of Mexico Continental Slope Habitats and Benthic Ecology (DGoMB) program is funded by the Minerals Management Services (MMS). The program is intended to provide information to the MMS to develop a better understanding of the deep-sea areas that will be potentially impacted by current and future exploration and production of fossil fuel reserves in the deep water Gulf of Mexico (GOM), defined as the area with water depths from 300 to 3000 meters and mostly in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the United States. The study is focused on areas that are most likely to be the target of future resource exploration and production. However, to develop an understanding of deep-sea communities, sampling in areas beyond those thought to be potential areas for exploration may be needed. A Gulf-wide perspective is sought to define the structure and function of the deep-sea communities of interest.

The proposed program will provide a better understanding of:

the present condition of biological communities in the study area, 
the distribution and patterns of important deep-sea biota, 
the biological and physical processes that control the environmental setting, and the effects that these processes have on the character of benthic and benthopelagic communities. 
The study emphasizes understanding the make-up and variability of soft-bottom biological communities with a secondary effort to characterize the important biological and abiotic processes that sustain or change the observed patterns. The study will:

detail the composition and structure of slope biological communities 
infer the relationship between these communities and local conditions and forcing factors, characterize the health and functioning of deep-sea communities, and compare and contrast the GOM region with similar oceanic basins.

... parameters that serve as indicators of changes in the ecosystem. The target species of the project are the Antarctic Shag Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis, the Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata, the Weddell Seal Leptonichotes weddelli, the Antarctic fur Seal Arctocephalus gazella and different benthic-demersal and pelagic Antarctic fish. One of the main achievements of the project was to develop a methodology to monitor changes in coastal fish populations through the analysis of the diet of the Antarctic Shag. This methodology was adopted as a &amp;Standard Method&amp; by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: PHOENIX
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=432

We propose an international, scientifically and technologically interdisciplinary investigation the Antarctic Dry Valleys, to understand the signature of climate variability as written into the soils and to quantify the abundance of life's building blocks there and at the ice-soil boundary. Our field campaign provides a thorough examination of the Dry Valley's physical and chemical nature, using an integrated analysis of multiple data sets. Since the Antarctic dry valleys are among the coldest, driest places on Earth, they are an end-member environment that can be used for comparison to less harsh regions on Earth and more extreme environments on other planets. To that end, we leverage the mission return of the currently funded NASA Phoenix Mars mission, which will land between 65-72?N during the International Polar Year, by providing a direct comparison of the two analogous regions. The proposed project also highly complements Phoenix, as it will enhance the validation of two instruments, thereby strengthening the Phoenix data interpretation and perhaps allowing for an increased understanding of the different evolutionary paths of these two planets.
The northern polar region of Mars has many similarities to the several analog regions on the Earth, especially the Antarctic Dry Valleys. The Mars polar region is known to have a substantial amount of water-ice within the top meter of the surface (e.g., Boynton et al., 2002) with a dry overburden of a fraction of a meter thick. In addition, the atmospheric water content on Mars is extremely small only 100 pr microns at it's annual peak. Furthermore, it is thought that the north polar regions undergo climatic changes over an obliquity cycle that could melt this ice reservoir (Jakosky et al., 2003), making this region one of the most likely places on Mars to sustain life should it ever have developed. Because of the interest in tracking life forms to the most extreme environments, the knowledge gained from examining atmospheric, chemical, and mineralogical processes in this pristine region of Mars will be highly complementary in understanding similar regions on the Earth.
Two of the engineering model instruments that were built to fly aboard the Phoenix spacecraft, the wet chemistry laboratory and the thermal and electrical conductivity probe, will be used in the field in Antarctica. Samples will also be collected and analyzed in Phoenix analog optical and atomic-force microscopy stations, as well as an analog thermal analyzer and gas analysis instrument.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">[Source: COMITE Data Set Home Page, http://www.imber.info/index.php/Science/Endorsed-projects/COMITE-December-2011 ]

Temperature is a major driver of microbial plankton metabolism and ecosystem function although its interactions with other variables such as nutrient availability or predation pressure have precluded a comprehensive assessment of its role in the coastal ocean. Ecological theories linking temperature to metabolism, body size and abundance have been successfully applied to many groups of organisms including phytoplankton, with heterotrophic bacteria being frequently left aside. For instance, the growing consensus that bacterial biomass will increase in a warmer ocean likely characterized by lower phytoplankton biomass contradicts the predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology. Unraveling the reasons for this apparent departure underlies the objectives of this project. Both the biodiversity and functioning of pelagic ecosystems will likely be affected by temperature changes.

COMITE will address the effects of future warming on the ecology and biogeochemical role of temperate coastal microbial assemblages through three different approaches:

1. a retrospective analysis of the linkages between temperature, other environmental drivers and bacterial community structure and size-abundance relationships in a coastal time-series initiated in 2002 off Xixón, Spain (southern Bay of Biscay);
   
2. monthly experiments assessing the response of different bacterial groups to ambient temperature plus -3 and +3ºC over a complete annual cycle;
   
3. comprehensive evaluation of the temperature-dependence of organic matter fluxes through microbial plankton at four significant oceanographic periods (spring phytoplankton bloom, summer stratification, autumn bloom and winter mixing).

The final goal of COMITE data analysis is to build a predictive, testable model on the effects of realistic temperature rises on the biogeochemical role of oceanic bacteria. Among other novel approaches, the project will:

1. test for the first time whether enhanced metabolism due to higher temperature will result in lower bacterial biomass;
    
2. integrate bacterial phylogenetic and physiological structure within the temperature response as formulated in the metabolic theory of ecology.

The WAIS project has successfully focused a broad cross-section of the
Antarctic research community on two urgent global issues: future sea level and
rapid climate change. WAIS is multidisciplinary and the support will help to
foster continued cross-disciplinary interaction. WAIS workshops began in 1990;
first to formulate the objectives of WAIS and, beginning in 1992, to exchange
and present scientific findings in a forum where cross-disciplinary scientific
discourse was promoted and progress toward WAIS goals could be annually
assessed. These workshops have been the backbone of this cooperative scientific
effort. The WAIS community has voiced its support for continuing these
workshops on an annual basis. Funds are provided to support future WAIS
workshops in three ways: first, to assist in the notification, organization and
execution of annual workshops for the next three years; second, to further
enhance these workshops by offering travel stipends to attract new participants
deemed by the WAIS Working Group to be key persons in further enhancing the
WAIS program; and third, to maintain a web site for workshop organization and
to serve as a clearinghouse for information relevant to the WAIS research
community.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The River-Atmosphere-Coast Study (RACS) of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom studies land-sea interactions in the coastal zone and the major exchanges (physical, chemical &amp; biological) between rivers and estuaries and the atmosphere.

The east coast of Britain between Berwick-on-Tweed and Great Yarmouth is the ... chosen site for RACS. The coastal marine study consists of several seasonal research cruises (using the NERC vessel 'RRS Challenger') along the east coast of the UK, probing the North Sea, its major estuaries (the Wash, the Humber, the Tyne and the Tees) and the English Channel. The data include RRS Challenger cruises 99 (December 1992), 108 (November/December 1993) and 115 (October/November 1994). The objectives of the cruises were to define the characteristics of the plume emanating from the Humber/Wash estuaries into the coastal zone, and to carry out surveys of the LOIS coastal study area, with particular attention given to sediment and suspended particulate matter (SPM) characteristics and water quality. 

In addition, an intensive study of fluxes in the Humber Estuary is taking place aboard the NRA's vessel 'Sea Vigil', monitoring processes as far inland as the Aire-Ouse confluence.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Deception Volcanology Observatory was created in 1993 for the Instituto Antartico Argentino (Argentine Antarctic Institute) and for the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas de Espa (Spanish High Council of Scientific Investigations). Its creation was in response to the reactivation of volcanoes on Deception Island in 1991-1992, and the purpose of the project was to monitor the volcanic activity present in the island. The project consisted of work to establish volcanic vigilance across the seismic registration present in the island, control of geothermal anomalies by soil and water, and analysis of composition variation in fumarole gasses and water sites on the island.

The purpose in this project will be the global evaluation of the information obtained and finally building a model that permits accurate predictions about the changes in the activity of this volcanic system (i.e. its pre-eruption, or eruption). This model could ultimately be used in the prediction of active volcanoes which have similar characteristics to Deception. The project will also complete the geologic study of the island, mainly with respect to its geologic structures and primary and secondary pyroclastic deposits. The intent is to create new models of pyroclastic deposition by observing the processes in action. With the knowledge of stratigraphy and structural geology, the project will provide new data for the geological evolution of the island.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Boreal Ecosystem - Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) was a large-scale experiment initiated in 1990 to investigate interactions between the boreal forest biome and the atmosphere. Surface, airborne, and satellite-based observations were collected to study the biological and physical processes and conditions that govern the exchanges of radiative energy, water, heat, carbon, and trace gases between boreal forest ecosystems and the atmosphere, particularly those processes that may be sensitive to global change.

The objectives of the BOREAS project were:

-To improve process models that describe the exchanges of radiative energy, water, heat, carbon, and trace constituents between the boreal forest and the atmosphere.

-To develop methods for applying the process models over large spatial scales using remote sensing and other integrative modeling techniques.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Long Term Archive (LTA) at the National Center for Earth Resource Observations and Science (EROS) in Sioux Falls, SD is one of the largest civilian remote sensing data archives. It contains a comprehensive record of the Earth's changing land surface. Scientists from around the world depend on this archive to conduct research on changes that affect our environment, resources, health, and safety. Time series images are a valuable resource for scientists, disaster managers, engineers, educators, and the general public. USGS EROS has archived, managed, and preserved land remote sensing data for more than 35 years and is a leader in preserving land remote sensing imagery. USGS EROS has a mandate to provide access and data preservation support for its land remote sensing data archive.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Center for Earth Resource Observations and Science (EROS) initially operated in an office in downtown Sioux Falls, South Dakota that opened on September 28, 1971. The Karl E. Mundt Federal Building is located in the countryside about 15 miles northeast of Sioux Falls. Built to exclusively support the activities of EROS, the building was officially dedicated on August 7, 1973. NASA and USGS announced on August 28,1990 that EROS would process, archive and distribute land processes data received from EOS satellites, thus establishing a Distributed Active Archive Center, or DAAC. A 65,000 square-foot addition to the building was constructed to support this new role, and was dedicated on August 19, 1996.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The FLORENCE program (FLux Oceaniques Restitues par bilan d'ENergie a la
surfaCE, or ocean fluxes restored from surface energy budgets) involved
determination of fluxes from SST observations combined with stress and
radiative flux estimates from satellite data alone. The FLORENCE method
consists of the inverse of a three-dimensional oceanic mixed-layer model in
order to infer the net surface heat flux that yields an exact simulation of the
observed SST, the model being otherwise forced by wind stress data.

Determination of turbulent fluxes along the trajectories of drifting buoys
equipped with thermistor chains allows to adjust the FLORENCE technique and
gives some insight on flux variability. The use of such buoys in
ocean-atmosphere experiments allows to retrieve fluxes under various weather
conditions and to compare air-sea fluxes evaluations with direct measurements
performed by ship, aircraft, and moored buoys.

Four Marisonde GT drifters, using Argos for location and data collection, were
released during the TOGA COARE Intensive Observing Period. On an hourly basis,
the buoys measured SST, wind speed, wind direction, and water temperature down
to a depth of 150 meters nominal (15-m intervals). Atmospheric pressure
(one-minute sampling) was measured at the same time every three hours (excepted
on buoy 15500).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Open Geospatial Consortium/Web Coverage Service is a specification
developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium that describes the Web Coverage
Service (WCS) that supports the networked interchange of geospatial data as
"coverages" containing values or properties of geographic locations. Unlike the
Web Map Service (WMS) (OGC document #01-021r2), which filters and portrays
spatial data to return static maps (server-rendered as pictures), the Web
Coverage Service provides access to intact (unrendered) geospatial information,
as needed for client-side rendering, multi-valued coverages, and input into
scientific models and other clients beyond simple viewers.

The Web Coverage Service consists of three operations: GetCapabilities,
GetCoverage, and DescribeCoverageType. The GetCapabilities operation returns an
XML document describing the service and the data collections from which clients
may request coverages.  Clients would generally run the GetCapabilities
operation and cache its result for use throughout a session, or reuse it for
multiple sessions. The GetCoverage operation of a Web Coverage Service is
normally run after GetCapabilities has determined what queries are allowed and
what data are available. The Get- Coverage operation returns values or
properties of geographic locations, bundled in a well-known coverage format.
Its syntax and semantics are similar to the WMS GetMap request, but several
extensions support the retrieval of coverages rather than static maps.

The Division of Atmospheric Research took part in ARM's TOGA COARE
(Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere/Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response
Experiment.) PROBE experiment at Kavieng, New Guinea (2.5S, 150.8W) in
January - February, 1993. This afforded an opportunity to use the new
radiometer alongside the CSIRO Mark II radiometer in a direct
comparison. The Division's 0.532 m lidar was also used, and the data
obtained on cirrus clouds, as well as some altocumulus, will be
analyzed with the LIRAD method. The PROBE will also provide excellent
radiosonde data every six hours, together with continuous microwave
data of water vapour column and cloud liquid water column observations
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations's (NOAA)
Wave Propagation Laboratory (WPL). The water vapour column data will
be invaluable in allowing for any variations in water vapour radiance
and transmittance at times between radiosonde observations.

        A preliminary analysis of the data indicates the variability
of the cirrus and its considerable geometrical depth at times and also
the persistence of the cirrus cover. Particularly interesting was an
apparent diurnal variation in both the cirrus cover and the optical
depth with a maximum at about midday.

        The ARM filter radiometer was run for about 70% of the time on the
        8.62 m filter; however, for some periods, the radiometer was
        run with the 10.86 m filter enabling a direct comparison with
        the Mark II radiometer which used a 10.84 m filter. As the
        input radiance is chopped against a 40C blackbody, the zero
        radiance when viewing liquid nitrogen actually gives a large
        negative signal; whereas, the zero voltage occurs when the
        input radiance is from a 40C blackbody. The responses of the
        two radiometers to various clouds are quite evident. The water
        vapour radiance is large, which is typical for the
        tropics. Periodically, there are either cirrus radiances or
        larger cumulus radiances superposed. Also evident is the
        superior behaviour of the new ARM radiometer. The two
        radiometer apertures were equal in the comparison; however,
        the ARM and Mark II time-constants were 1 second and 5
        seconds, respectively. By looking at the signal and noise
        levels during the calibration episodes in!  more detail, we
        calculate the minimum detectable radiances (MDR) of the two
        instruments as 4.9 x hz-1/2(ARM) and 6.8 X hz-1/2(CSIRO Mark
        II).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: ATMOPOL
Project URL: http://www.unis.no/staff_homepages/RolandK/ATMOPOL.htm
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=76

The project aims at establishing a long-term Arctic-Antarctic network of monitoring stations for atmospheric monitoring of anthropogenic pollution. Based upon the long and excellent experiences with different scientific groups performing air monitoring within the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), an expanded network will be established including all AMAP stations and all major Antarctic "year-around" research stations. As an integrated project within the "International Polar Year 2007-08" initiative, the ATMOPOL co-operation intend to:

- Establish a long-term coordinated international Arctic-Antarctic contaminant programme.
- Develop and implement a joint sampling and monitoring strategy as an official guideline for all participating stations.
- Support bi-polar international atmospheric research with high-quality data on atmospheric long-range transport of contaminants (sources, pathways and fate).
- Support future risk assessment of contaminants for Polar Regions based on effects of relevant contamination levels and polar organisms

Based upon the well-established experiences of circum-Arctic atmospheric contaminant monitoring in the Arctic under the AMAP umbrella, a bi-polar atmospheric contaminant network will be established and maintained. In conjunction with the polar network of atmospheric monitoring stations for air pollution, surface-based and satellite instrumentation will be utilised to provide the characterization of the Arctic atmospheric-water-ice cycle. Together with numerical weather prediction and chemical transport model calculations, simultaneous measurements of pollutants at various locations in the Arctic and Antarctic will enhance our understanding of chemical transport and distribution as well as their long-term atmospheric trends. In addition to investigating the importance of atmospheric transport of pollutants an understanding of the transference and impact of these pollutants on both terrestrial and marine environments will be sought. A secretariat and a "scientific project board" will be established. During this initial phase of the project (2006), a guideline on priority target compounds, sampling strategies, equipment and instrumentation, analytical requirements, as well as quality assurance protocols (including laboratory intercalibration exercises) will be developed and implemented. 

The ATMOPOL initiative aims to address highly relevant environmental change processes and, thus, will strive to answering the following scientific questions:
- How does climate change influence the atmospheric long-range transport of pollutants?
- Are environmental scientists able to fill the gaps in international pollution inventories and identification of possible sources for atmospheric pollution in Polar Regions?
- What are the differences in transport pathways and distribution patterns of various atmospheric pollutants between Arctic and Antarctic environments? Why are there such differences?
- What is the final fate of atmospherically transported pollutants and how does this impact on the environment and indigenous people?

In order to understand the underlying atmospheric chemistry of pollution, e.g. atmospheric mercury deposition events, routine surface measurements of UV radiation as well as campaign related measurements of UV radiation profiles will also be included.The project will establish a cooperative network on atmospheric contaminant monitoring in Polar Regions far beyond the IPY 2007/08 period and is, thus, planned as an "open-end" programme. All produced data will be available for all participating institutions for scientific purposes as basis for joint publications and reports from the ATMOPOL database to be developed.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=305

COMAAR will be established as a consortium under the auspices of the Arctic Council, composed of AC Working Groups, major observation and monitoring networks, platforms/observatories, government agencies and other relevant institutions involved in observation and monitoring in the Arctic. The main objectives of COMAAR are to increase effectiveness and efficiency in the use of infrastructure, personnel and funding, and to improve coordination for sustained long-term time series observations and for data handling.

COMAAR will bring together conventional scientific approaches to observation and monitoring with local and traditional knowledge approaches. This will lead to synergies and added value in data availability that will underpin a new generation of scientific analysis, publications and assessments for policy making. At the same time, COMAAR will facilitate communication between the scientific community and Arctic residents, as well as society at large that will lead to a better understanding of living conditions and resource availability as well as new opportunities for the next generation of researchers. COMAAR will provide a united front to enhance sustainability of existing observatories/platforms and the development of new observatories/platforms, methodologies and technologies.

COMAAR will be managed by a Steering Committee with balanced representation from different disciplines. Coordination tasks will be undertaken by task teams and thematic and multidisciplinary panels that will be set up to address specific issues that will change over time. They include: establishing centralised data and metadata bases for monitoring and observation of the Arctic, harmonisation and standardisation of methods and metadata, data and metadata handling, and providing information for an Arctic portal. COMAAR will also provide a forum for continuous consultation and interaction between consortium partners. They will meet at regular intervals and in varying configurations to move the coordination process forward.

COMAAR will contribute to: improved capacity for assessing and predicting the current and future state of the Arctic, substantially more efficient overall access to data, improved data management protocols and quality controlled data, international information sharing and dissemination of data, increased capability to identify gaps in the current knowledge base, improved linkages and understanding between Arctic residents, science researchers, logistics operators, political decision makers, funding agencies, and educators, improved knowledge transfer and information flow between platforms and user groups.

Major deliverables provided by COMAAR will include:
-bridges among a range of multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral stakeholders within and outside the Arctic Council,
-coordinated input of observation and monitoring metadata and data for an Arctic portal, a global system of systems, international and regional conventions and other regulatory frameworks,
-coordinated major multi-disciplinary baseline data sets, agreed metadata, operating guidelines, and protocols,
-a forum for continuous consultation and regular meetings of consortium partners.

THE HEARD ISLAND FEASIBILITY TEST (HIFT) was developed to study the
propagation of underwater sound waves across whole oceans, possibly as
a means of monitoring ocean temperatures on a large scale. (The speed
of sound in water depends on the water temperature.) In January 1991 a
series of coded sound waves was transmitted from an underwater station
near Heard Island in the southern Indian Ocean. The waves were later
detected across a network of 16 sites (some on board vessels at sea)
positioned along great-circle sightlines (or perhaps soundlines would
be a more appropriate term) around the world. One example: the signal
took 2.95 hours to reach the Bermuda station 16,000 km away. The
researchers were generally satisfied with the quality of the received
signals, as measured by the signal-to-noise ratio and the stability of
the waveform over time. They suggested, however, that for monitoring
ocean climate variability acoustic thermometry should be integrated
with satellite me!  asurements. On another point of concern, the
scientists found no evidence that the sound transmissions produced any
distress among local marine mammals.  (17 papers in the Journal of the

SCICEX is a 5 year program (1995-1999) in which the Navy has made
available a Sturgeon-class, nuclear powered, attack submarine for
unclassified science cruises to the Arctic Ocean. Beginning with a
test cruise in 1993, civilian scientists together with Navy personnel
have collected a variety of information on the geology, physics,
chemistry and biology of this critical region. The unmatched mobility
of submarines in ice covered oceans has allowed data to be collected
from over 100,000 miles of shiptrack in the Arctic providing samples
from some regions that have never before been visited. The purpose of
this page is twofold; 1) to make public information about the program
and some of its accomplishments; and 2) to provide for exchange of

streams. STORM-WAVE is a collaborative effort in conjunction
with the VORTEX-95 and GCIP/ESOP-95 projects.

The objectives of STORM-WAVE are to: 1) Collect and provide a
research quality data set to support storm-season mesoscale
research in the central United States; 2) Collect
high-resolution (spatial and temporal) continuous observations
for model verification and sensitivity studies; 3) Provide a
research-quality database for use in the evaluation of the
NOAA/NWS Modernization Program; and 4) Collect selected
hydrological data during a critical part of the water year
(spring/early summer).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">North American (NLDAS) and Global (GLDAS) LDAS systems are being developed that will lead to more accurate reanalysis and forecast simulations by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Specifically, these systems will reduce the errors in the stores of soil moisture and energy which are often present in NWP models and which degrade the accuracy of forecasts. NLDAS is currently running retrospectively and in near real-time on a 1/8th-degree grid while GLDAS is running at 1/4 degree resolution. The systems are currently forced by terrestrial (NLDAS) and space based (GLDAS) precipitation data, space-based radiation data and numerical model output. In order to create an optimal scheme, the projects involve several LSMs, many sources of data, and several institutions. Data from the project can be accessed on the NLDAS and GLDAS forcing pages, the NLDAS and GLDAS model output pages, as well as on the NLDAS Realtime Image Generator page.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">High-quality bottom pressure recorder ( BPR ) measurements in the deep ocean contribute to a fundamental understanding of oceanographic processes over a wide range of time scales. These vary from long-period fluctuations induced by planetary waves, oceanic tides, and meteorological forcing events, to relatively shorter-period phenomena such as long surface gravity waves, microseisms, and tsunamis. To capture these events, several types of transducers have been incorporated into pressure sensor units designed for oceanic applications. The most common types include the vibrating wire, strain gauge, quartz-resonator, Bourdon tube, and various capacitance devices. Vibrating wire designs typically correlate vibrational frequency with pressure-induced mechanical motion (Lefcort 1968; Vitousek and Miller 1970). Capacitance plate transducers such as those described by Harris and Tucker (1963) incorporate parallel capacitance plates in which the distance between plates varies as a function of applied pressure. Capacitance is inversely proportional to the plate gap and acts to tune an LC oscillator.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">History of Program:
      
       The Smithsonian Institution has long had an interest in marine
       mammals, starting with the hiring of Spencer Fullerton Baird in
       1850 as assistant secretary with the responsibility of the
       directorship of the United States National Museum. In 1878
       Baird became the second secretary of the Smithsonian
       Institution, a position he held until his death in 1887. Baird
       was an avid naturalist with a bent towards the marine
       environment. His interest lead to the hiring of such eminent
       naturalists as Leonard Stejneger and William H. Dall. Although
       Stejneger was most known for his work in herpetology and Dall
       in mollusks, they were part of a body of researchers who
       contributed to the study of marine mammals whenever
       possible. Baird also was implemental in the forming of the
       United States Fish Commission in 1871 and became the first
       director of that commission. The Fish Commission has gone
       through a variety of names changes, from the Bureau of
       Commercial Fisheries up through the National Mar!  ine
       Fisheries Service. The Commission has always had an interest in
       marine mammals fostered by the interests of its first
       director. The current Marine Mammal Program of the Smithsonian
       maintains a excellent working relationship with the National
       Marine Fisheries Service resulting in numerous additions to the
       marine mammal collection.
      
      Current Marine Mammal Program:
      
      The Marine Mammal Program is a cooperative research program whose
      principal goal is to extract all biological data that we can from
      stranded and incidentally taken animals. Strandings form our only means
      of access to better than half of the cetacean species. It is possible
      to gain data on many aspects of the normal life history of cetaceans
      through a thorough examination of these specimens. We routinely
      collect data and specimens that relate to stomach contents, relative
      organ weights, parasite burden, reproductive condition and stage of
      physical maturity. We also take external morphometrics and photographs
      of the external pigmentation pattern. This data forms the basis for
      all of Dr. Mead's current research publications.

The Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) and the
National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) were developed
to monitor dry and wet acid deposition,
respectively. Monitoring site locations are predominantly rural
by design to assess the relationship between regional pollution
and changes in regional patterns in deposition. CASTNET also
includes measurements of rural ozone and the chemical
constituents of PM 2.5. Rural monitoring sites of NADP and
CASTNET provide data where sensitive ecosystems are located and
provide insight into natural background levels of pollutants
where urban influences are minimal. These data provide needed
information to scientists and policy analysts to study and
evaluate numerous environmental effects, particularly those
caused by regional sources of emissions for which long range
transport plays an important role. Measurements from these
networks are also important for understanding non-ecological
impacts of air pollution such as visibil!  ity impairment and
damage to materials, particularly those of cultural and
historical importance.

CASTNET stations measure:

1. weekly average atmospheric concentrations of sulfate,
nitrate, ammonium, sulfur dioxide, and nitric acid.

2. hourly concentrations of ambient ozone levels.

3. meteorological conditions required for caclulating dry
deposition rates

The last major field experiment of the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) evolved from its sub-program on the Air-Flow Over and Around Mountains, called Alpine Experiment (ALPEX).

The project has focused on circulations due to wind forcing, including storm surges in the Adriatic and Western Mediterranean Sea. This project was in direct support of the World Meteorological Organization with 20 nations taking part in the project. The specific tasks of the project were: 

1. To investigate the mechanism of cyclogenesis in the lee of mountains, 
2. To study local mountain wind phenomena such as foehn, mistral and bora, 
3. To determine the total drag of a mountain - complex (Alps), 
4. To measure the vertical flux of horizontal momentum in lee - waves, 
5. To observe orographic influences on precipitation, floods, and heat budget.

The world data center for meteorology located in the NCDC provides information on ALPEX data transferred to NCDC from the designated ALPEX collection centers. Information is available on selected national archive data upon request. Information may be provided for: 

1. ALPEX quick-look data sets (a) microfilm, (b) digital.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=171</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The proposed activity aims at establishing a bipolar network to obtain data needed to quantify properties of aerosols at high latitudes, including seasonal background concentrations by measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD), spectral characterizations, and the evolutionary patterns of the natural and anthropogenic processes that perturb the aerosol cycles. An effort to quantify direct and indirect climate forcing by polar aerosols will be made through a set of closure experiments using observations in conjunction with model calculation and satellite data.
The co-operation in the frame of POLAR-AOD will allow the following:
1. - Definition of calibration procedures among the various sun-radiometers operating in Polar regions, in order to achieve homogeneous AOD (aerosol optical depth) evaluations and maintain a set of reference instruments in a high mountain station. Some of the instruments will be used to constitute a traveller system from one station to the other with the aim of attaining 'round robin' inter-comparison. Regular inter-comparison campaigns (biennial) will be organized in order to compare not only calibration constants but also instrumental characteristics, such as sensitivity and influence of diffuse light. The first inter-comparison campaign, scheduled for spring 2006 at Ny-Alesund, will be used also to define and adjust the methodology and calculation procedures, like that aimed at evaluating relative optical air mass and trace-gas corrections.
2 . - Improvement of "in-situ" optical and chemical measurements, with an effort to operate size and time-resolved aerosol composition and concentration sampling on a long-term base (EoI ID 557).
3. - Establishment of a data bank for spectral sun-photometric measurements (AOD archive), in-situ measurements and any other aerosol related parameters useful for assessing the quantification of aerosols and their radiative effects. This archive will fill the gap for the polar regions within the global aerosol climatology, where there is an urgent need for high-quality data on aerosol abundance and physico-chemical characteristics on a regional scale. The information is necessary to better constrain climate model simulations and improve the interpretation of remotely sensed data. Particular attention will be paid to retrospective analyses of historical data-sets, mainly from Russian Arctic and Antarctic stations. They will be recovered and stored in the archive.
4. - Determination of reliable procedures for analysing sun-photometric and sun-radiometric data in order to describe realistically the specific conditions occurring in the polar regions. Standard programmes will be developed and supplied to the research groups involved, including cloud rejection algorithms and radiometric data analysis.
5 - Organisation of international workshops for the presentation of the results from the various polar programs, and for the discussion of common strategies and goals, including aspects of logistics within inter-calibration activities and data exchange.
In Antarctica, the actual field activities will benefit from the setting up of a new international long-term monitoring programme, called TAVERN (Quantification of Tropospheric Aerosol and Thin Clouds Variability, including Radiation Budget over the East Antarctic Plateau) at the recently established Italian-French station Dome Concordia (EoI ID 198). Year-round measurements based on LIDAR, Sun and Star photometer and "in-situ" aerosol systems will make it possible to study in detail inter-annual and seasonal variation of aerosols over the high Antarctic Plateau, and also to obtain information on the thin cloud optical depth. The normal activities in other stations will be extended during the IPY operational period (EoI ID 797). The POLAR-AOD observations will complement the SRB measurements which are developed at other stations (Syowa, South Pole, Neumayer) in the frame of the BSRN (GCOS) activities, providing an important contribution for assessing forcing by aerosols.
In the Arctic, additional strong field activities will be promoted at the Greenland Summit Station (EoI ID 530) and Tiksi (EoI ID 820), during the IPY operational period. Real-time measurements of physical, chemical and optical properties of aerosols will allow the constitution of a data set in the Arctic, equivalent to the one acquired over the Antarctic Plateau, Summit being a natural counterpart of Dome Concordia. Also in Ny-Alesund, research activities related to aerosols will increase as a consequence of the efforts of Norway, Poland, Germany, Japan and Italy (EoIs ID 165, ID 597). The network will give support in obtaining high-quality integrated data from the large amount of field activities. Participation on cruises organised in the framework of the Arctic Experiment (AREX) and the airborne ASTAR (Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosol, Clouds, and Radiation) activities will lead to a considerable improvement in knowledge on the vertical and spatial distribution of aerosols in the European Arctic. The present studies will complement the activities promoted by the SEARCH Program (NOAA's Study of Environmental Arctic Change). Finally the information obtained will allow participants to assess the influence of mid-latitude aerosol sources in the observed Arctic aerosol budget.
POLAR-AOD (EoIs ID 299, ID 557) will join the efforts of the IASOA proposal (EoI ID 138), in the task of co-ordinating different programmes of long-term atmospheric observatories in the Arctic with the purpose of setting up a circumpolar ring around the central Arctic region. The second aim is to fulfil the need for an integrated larger bi-polar network in the field of atmospheric sciences.

Introduction:

The exploitation of natural resources in polar areas is an instructive example of the way man is exploiting the natural resources in the world. The voyages of discovery in the second half of the 16th century and later, during the so called Heroic Century of Polar Exploration (1870-1920), including the first International Polar Year (1882-1883), made it possible for the western colonial powers to penetrate into the polar areas. The voyages of discovery not only led to the exploitation of natural resources but also to scientific research. In both cases, stations were built to facilitate the work and to lodge the people. According to Friedmanns core/periphery concept (1966) the polar areas can be called Resource Frontier Regions because they produce raw material for the industrial centres in the world core areas (Sugden 1982). Whaling, fur hunting and mining have produced raw materials for the international market for more than 400 years. These activities were carried out by companies and people from outside the polar regions. The companies belonged to the worldwide actor networks (Latour 1986, Law &amp; Callon 1992) in the core areas and local networks in the polar areas.It is notable how similar the developments were in both polar areas. One can divide the exploitation of natural resources in both areas into two phases: directly after the discovery a first phase in which fur hunters and whalers from different countries were active and a second phase in which the activities were focussed on the exploitation of minerals.Scientific research has increased the knowledge of both areas and contributed to the understanding of global processes. The industrial settlements and the research stations have played an important geopolitical role and have serious impact on the natural environment and in the Arctic on indigenous communities. Many sites belong to the polar cultural heritage nowadays. 

Aim and strategy:

Until now, the history of science in and exploitation of polar areas were almost exclusively studied from a regional and national approach based on written sources from the archives in the countries in the core region. The aim of this project is to study the various (hunting, whaling, mining and research) settlements/stations from a bipolar, international and comparative perspective. Field and archive research will be done to collect the necessary data. The outcome of the various studies will be compared with each other to acquire more knowledge about the history of scientific research and the exploitation of the natural resources, the impact on the natural environment and the indigenous peoples. Finally the geopolitical consequences of the stations will be studied using written and material sources.The project will start in 2006 with archive research carried out to acquire more insight into the historical context. Much archive research will be done by the participants of the project in their various countries. This will produce a body of documentation, photo and film material which may be used not only for research but also in outreach activities. Field surveys will be carried out jointly on various already known sites in both polar areas. Several selected sites will be mapped and photo documented completely and compared with archival data. In 2007-2008 field work will be done on places difficult to reach. The data analysis of the various sites will be carried out jointly. The databases and maps will be collected in Groningen and made available for cultural heritage purposes and outreach activities. Finally a synthesis will be made which will be published in a joint publication in English and translated in several other languages.

Project URL: http://www.iassa.gl/icass6/icass6.htm
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=69

ICASS VI will be held in Nuuk, Greenland in the International Polar Year 2007-2008, at the earliest at end of the first calendar year of operations for the IPY. To the international arctic social sciences community, ICASS VI will act as its major forum to review its contribution to the overall IPY effort; to discuss the status of the ongoing social programs under IPY 2007-2008; and to make plans for further actions.
 
The working title for ICASS VI is "Circumpolar Social Changes: Opportunities and Challenges for Social Sciences in the International Polar Year 2007-2008." Based upon the attendance at previous ICASS ventures (a triennial event), ICASS VI will bring together many hundred social scientists from every field of social and human research, advanced students from over 20 countries, as well as indigenous and non-indigenous stakeholders. We expect the attendance to be boosted by the presence of our project partners from physical and natural science disciplines, to make ICASS VI a fully interdisciplinary venture - much like the IPY 2007-2008 itself. 

The main goal of ICASS VI is to offer various venues for IPY scholars, other northern researchers, and local participants to analyze the progress of IPY 2007-2008 in social and human fields. This includes special project sessions, discussion panels, plenary presentations, invited talks by the leading IPY scientists and representatives of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, public meetings. Sessions and panels at the ICASS VI will be framed along major IPY research fields and initiatives, with the broad international and interdisciplinary participation. For many international network projects, ICASS sessions will offer the only chance for face-to-face discussions, as participants from many countries and regions may have limited contacts in the field and across the boundaries. Special efforts will be made to ensure presence of as many project collaborators from arctic communities, as possible. 

Having ICASS VI held in Nuuk, the capital of the only indigenous self-governing Arctic country, will give an unprecedented voice to polar residents and indigenous peoples. Timing and location for this major scholarly meeting to review the progress of IPY 2007-2008 cannot be better selected. ICASS sessions will be open to representatives of northern governmental agencies, indigenous institutions, media people, and interested public to ensure broader input from northern practitioners and local communities. We envision ICASS VI also as a critical milestone to the IPY 2007-2008 outreach, public, and educational agendas, because of so many young Greenlandic students and educational institutions in town. The presence of social scientists from many countries, presentations on many projects across the circumpolar world will inspire the young generation of Greenlandic educators and leaders, and will give tremendous local publicity to polar research.

    JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
    transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
    Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
    Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
    meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
    oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
    terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
    board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
    meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
    and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
    in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
    of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
    39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
    Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
    from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
    and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
    established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
    through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
    70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
    southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
    members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
    making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
    atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
    occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
    glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
    December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
    Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
    of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
    have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
    station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
    meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
    Mountains. However, year-round observations including
    meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
    atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
    1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
    Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
    established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
    sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
    observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
    Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
    important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
    accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
    Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
    protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
    Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
    and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
    Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
    monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
    glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
    as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
    population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
    and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
    compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
    occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
    change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
    described in the previous chapter.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: MOVE
Project URL: http://www.alaska.edu/boreas/move/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=436

MOVE is an international, collaborative attempt to address a major shortcoming in conceptualizing northern histories, presents and futures. While the phenomenon of state-induced population movements in the circumpolar North in the 20th and 21st centuries is well-known, to date no comparative analysis of their local and regional contexts and impacts has been undertaken. Although the role of the state in shaping the North has received some belated attention in recent years, the local expressions of moving, coping, rebuilding and remembering remain to be understood.

If seasonal and permanent population movements in the lives of circumpolar peoples were in the past responsive to the local conditions upon which subsistence life ways were based, population movements in the recent history of the North have been imposed by market and state logics of a conspicuously non-local character. Previous research on forms of relocation and resettlement sponsored by outside institutions has focused almost exclusively on the political motivations and repercussions, as well as demographic consequences of such movement. While these lines of inquiry are important, they provide few clues about local perceptions and impacts, or the persistent power of local agency to resist and condition projects of relocation. Similarly, while there is a long history of social science involvement with northern development planning and more recently with the sustainability of development -, there is a general failure to address the importance of social fabric within the context of resettlement and other population movements.

Moved by the state refers to the commonality of having to cope with relocations and other population movements triggered by outside decisions. In analyzing a broad array of case studies (small and large, indigenous and non-indigenous communities, in free market and central command systems, ranging from the mid-20th to the early 21st century), the collaborative research project intends to test the extent of commonality. Demographic, political, social and cultural variables will be used to track the similarities and differences, both among communities facing being moved now and those that have been moved in the past. Extensive fieldwork, combining participant observation, various interview and survey strategies, and the recording of oral and life histories, as well as demographic and economic data collection and analysis, will form the methodological backbone of the project. Thus, the impact of past and present relocations will be addressed through a dual strategy. On the one hand, a series of regional analyses of aggregate economic and demographic data will provide an overall picture of the population movements in question. On the other hand, ethnographic fieldwork in selected villages and towns of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia will add local context and emic perspectives.

In theoretical terms, the proposed research addresses the tension between the increasingly translocal and various senses of place. The question of how local identities, in or out of place (of origin) are constituted leads to a critical interrogation of the roles of cultural and practical engagements in creating and recreating place within a particular environment. The results of this research will become increasingly relevant in the ongoing negotiations between states and communities about location and relocation in the face of increasing social and climate change.

The TransAntarctic Mountains DeFormation Project (TAMDEF)is a
joint USGS and OSU program to measure crustal motion in the
Transantarctic Mountains of Southern Victoria Land.

Crustal movement is predicted as a result of variations in the
ice volume and loading of the East and West Antarctic Ice
Sheets through time. In addition we suspected there is active
tectonism associated with the Terror Rift, an offshore fault
zone that is nearby. There are also active volcanoes in the
region that may also be responsible for a measurable amount of
crustal deformation.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
While GulfCet I provided important information, it was not designed to
address fully the question: "What habitats do these animals prefer?"
GulfCet II (1996-1997) - the extension study - was sponsored and
administered by the Biological Resources Division of the
U.S. Geological Survey to meet information needs of the MMS.  One need
was to determine the distribution and abundance of whales and dolphins
in the eastern Gulf, an area of potential future oil and gas
exploration and production.  GulfCet II also continued surveys in the
western and central Gulf to monitor the abundance and distribution of
cetaceans.  Another component of GulfCet II was to conduct focal
studies specifically designed to address whale and dolphin
associations with habitats (physical environment and available prey).
These studies used satellite altimeter data to plan transect lines to
survey through cyclonic and anticyclonic gyres and determine cetacean
and seabird abundance within various hydrographic features.  GulfCet
II was the only marine mammal study that used an ecosystem approach,
integrating visual and acoustic surveys with satellite imaging,
hydrographic collections, and trawl samples.

The GulfCet II Study has shown us that sperm whales, and other
cetaceans, are found in conjunction with area of upwelling and
nutrient enrichment that enhance productivity and prey abundance.
Cetaceans in the northern Gulf of Mexico concentrate along the
continental slope in or near cyclones (upwelled waters) and the
confluence of cyclone-anticyclone eddy pairs.  Cyclones also had the
greatest diversity of seabird species, although habitat use varied
among species.  High numbers of zooplankton, lanternfish, and squid
were found inside cyclone and confluence areas.  While whales and
dolphins do not occur randomly in the gulf, it is important to
remember the dynamic nature of the hydrographic features with which
they associate.  As the features move and change, prey distribution
changes and moves, and so will the presence and movements of whales
and dolphins.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Soviet/American Gas and Aerosol Expedition</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Soviet/American Gas and Aerosol (SAGA) Expeditions II and III were
to measure radiatively important trace species in the marine
environment. NOAA/CMDL participated in both cruises in 1987 and 1990.
The overall goal of SAGA II was to evaluate the sources,
distributions, and fates of climatically significant trace species in
the remote, marine environment. The studies were to focus on obtaining
latitudinal distributions of key gaseous and aerosol species from 50 deg N
to 40 deg S, defining the downwind plume from continental Asia over the
West Pacific and East Indian Oceans, and evaluating the air-sea
exchange of biogenic and anthropogenic trace gases. NOAH and the
Carbon Cycle Group were responsible for the organization of
NOAA/CMDL's effort and the measurement of a suite of rediatively
important trace species (RITS) in both the water and the atmosphere.
Five trace gases in the surface water and atmosphere of the West
Pacific and East Indian Oceans were measured by automated gas
chromatography from May through July 1987. The data included more than
1000 measurements each of N2O, F11, and F12 in the surface water and
in the atmosphere, and about 2000 measurements each of CH4 and CO2 in
the surface water and atmospheric boundary layer of the West
Pacific. In addition, over 600 measurements of dissolved N2O were
obtained from hydrocasts made along the entire 45000 km cruise track.
The ship Akademik Korolev, used in the SAGA II expedition, departed
Hilo, HI on 1 May 1987, to proceed towards the Kuril trench, headed
south along 160 deg E and 170 deg E meridians and terminated its first
leg in Wellington, New Zealand on 9 June 1987. Leg 2 ran south of
Australia then north along 90 deg E to Singapore between 12 June and 6
July. Leg 3 began on 9 July in Singapore and was essentially a
transect along 5 deg N turning up toward Hilo, HI at 180 deg E where
it arrived on 28 July 1987.
The overall goal of SAGA III was similar to the one of SAGA II. In
addition, main objectives were to evaluate the spatial and temporal
variability of trace gases across the interhemispheric tropical
convergence zone (ITCZ), to trace the zonal movement of the ITCZ, to
determine halocarbon saturation anomalies and to assess their use in
calculating air-sea transfer coefficients, to measure the flux of N2O
from equatorial waters, and to compare the results to those made in
1987, an El Nino year.  As for SAGA II, the Akademik Korolev was used
during this expedition. The cruise began in February 1990 in Hilo, HI,
and crossed the equator seven times zig-zagging between 20 deg N and
15 deg S before ending in Singapore in April 1990.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=131

The Southern Ocean marine ecosystem has been exploited commercially for over 200 years, resulting in large shifts in ecosystem structure, as different elements of the marine food web have been intensely exploited. Over the last 25 years the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has not only managed the currently exploited species but has also taken a global lead in developing ecosystem-based management methods. Now the recognition that polar regions are undergoing substantial climate change heightens the urgency to understand how exploited marine ecosystems can be sustainably managed in an environment that is both extremely variable and changing.
 
In this core program we will study the biomass and production capacity of large marine ecosystems, focusing particularly on the geographic distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill, plankton and nekton, considering a combination of factors such as the interaction between species life cycles, ocean circulation, frontal systems, sea-ice cover, food supply, and concentration of vertebrate predators, such as fish, birds, and marine mammals. We will provide an integrated view of the communities and their functioning within the oceanic ecosystems. This will be done through ecosystem-based surveys to map the biological production at all trophic levels, and by comparing the trophic structure and interactions. Such studies are vital for the development of integrated large-ecosystem models that can be used to manage exploited species in an open ocean pelagic environment. 

Some component projects will cover large spatial regions such as the Southwest Atlantic at relatively low resolution while others focus on smaller areas to study in more detail the role of key species within the trophic web and consider the effect of seasonality. Key physical processes within the marine ecosystems will be monitored and modelled to establish the physical framework for exploring the variability of the biological production.

Objectives: Obtain a synoptic circumpolar assessment of the Antarctic marine pelagic resources, their environment, food supply and their main predators. 

Major field program activities:
- Undertake quasi-synoptic multi-disciplinary hydrographic (CTD) and biological (hydroacousticsand biological sampling) studies from the ice-edge or Antarctic continent northward across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to the Polar Front. These studies will cover key regions of the Southern Ocean and presently include the Southwest and Southeast Atlantic, the Ross and Weddell Seas.
- Census the large-scale distribution of predators and determine the interaction with prey.
- Determine the Circumpolar demography and population dynamics of key species
- Determine interaction of key species with seasonal sea ice in the ice-covered areas of the Weddell and Ross Seas.
- Determine seasonal variation in pelagic ecosystem

Modelling studies: 
The results from the field program activities will fill existing gaps in the quantitative experimental data available for input to conceptual ecosystem models (148, 397, 130) to explore the production potential of the systems and the effects of different harvesting regime. Development of such models will form a key part of both this Program and also a key link to the modelling work undertaken within the ICED Program (417).
 
Linkages:
The science goals of this Program depend on close integration between physical oceanography (of both continental margin and open ocean environments), biogeochemistry, ecology, sea ice studies and meteorology. In addition to the component projects within the Resources cluster we will also develop cross cluster linkages to ensure full inter-disciplinary integration. The division of IPY EOIs into disciplinary clusters is a necessary but artificial distinction. The science goals of CCAMLR depend on close integration between physical oceanography (of both continental margin and open ocean environments), biogeochemistry, ecology, sea ice studies, meteorology (EoI 16, 83, 109, 193, 417, 577).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: NobleMet
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=19

Due to modern industrial development, noble metals (platinum group elements-PGEs in short, such as Pt and Pd) are being used in a much broader field in recent decades. Over 20% of the goods produced in the West involve the use of PGEs somewhere in their manufacturing processes and Pt and Pd are the most widely used ones. Especially with automobile industry, noble metals and their compounds have been widely used as catalysts in automobile catalytic pollution control devices. Though those pollutants are mainly local, they are also transported to remote Arctic regions. What are the trends for those metals at present? How different comparing the current situation with the one in pre-industrial time period? Because one of the common characteristics for noble metals is reducing activation energy at reaction centres during chemical reactions and this characteristic could hold true for biochemical reactions, increasing worldwide pollution of PGEs may potentially exert affects on bio chemical reactions in the ecosystems and food chains. It is therefore of great value to investigate their past, present and trend in Arctic regions where undisturbed frozen water media preserves their archives.

This proposal is addressing some of those questions, aiming to:

1.To develop precise methodologies to determine the concentrations of those noble metals in the Canadian High Arctic, down to fg/g level or 10-15 gram per gram in order to accurately quantify the content of those pollutants in the ice. This work will require special ultra-clean technique, equipment/facility and expertises, which GSC (Geological Survey Canada, NRCan) and UH (University of Heidelberg, Germany) currently holds;

2.To reconstruct a temporal trend of those noble metal pollutants in the Canadian High Arctic for at least 50 years, possibly tracing back to pre-industrial time. This work requires precise dating and multi-discipline knowledge, including glaciology, ice-physics, analytical chemistry, statistics and geochemistry et al. Both GSC and UH also holds expertise in these fields. The site for this study is tentatively selected to be on Agassiz ice cap, Nunavut, Canada (Northern Ellesmere Island: 80 deg 48.0 N 72 deg 52.5 W; asl 1800 m);

3.To investigate the spatial distribution of those noble metal pollutants on ice caps, at least 4 to 6 ice caps will be occupied; and 4.Hopefully to apportion the sources of the pollutants whenever possible with the achieved data.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=338

The objective of the Arctic Quest project is to promote an increased interest and understanding of the arctic polar region internationally through the sharing of art of the 25 artists involved in the project between the North and South, from East to West in Canada and beyond. The goals of the Arctic Quest project are to form new connections with international artists and to cultivate vital cultural links between southern Canada's artistic community and Inuit artists at both professional and student levels, and to expose the resulting body of art to the Polar region communities and the international public to increase appreciation and awareness and stimulate interest in the fragile Polar region. 

For the first phase of the project 25 artists from Canada and the United will begin in 2006 with an Arctic voyage celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the first successful navigation of the Northwest Passage by Roald Amundsen. They will follow in the footsteps of famous explorers and great artists that have inspired them. They will paint the landscape, people, flora and fauna and weather as they interpret it. This voyage in Canadian, Greenland (Danish) and International waters, will retrace some of the early explorers and artists original routes, stopping periodically to sketch, paint and photograph what they see. After 12 days at sea, the group will return to their studios and record and develop their experiences in paint.

During the second phase of the project the artists will share their artistic interpretations in an extensive series of exhibitions throughout 2007 and 2008, planned to coincide with International Circumpolar Year. The Arctic Quest Exhibition is planned to contain artwork of early explorers, representatives of the Group of Seven (Harris, Varley, and A.Y. Jackson), Doris McCarthy and Maurice Haycock (two artists inspired by the Group of Seven) as well as the works of the 25 contemporary artists, who have been in turn inspired by those who went before. Works of Inuit artists will also be included.

Both elements of the project are supported by a variety of educational, outreach and legacy initiatives. For example, the Arctic Quest voyage will include art shows of local Inuit talents, invitations of local Inuit artists aboard the vessel, painting workshops with children to develop artistic skills and donations of artist materials to communities visited during the expedition. In addition the project will restore and dedicate the yellow cabin in Pangnirtung built by artist Maurice Haycock in 1926 during a year's surveying assignment with the Geological Survey of Canada. A restoration plan would be developed with the community: some thoughts at this time include a historic site, art library, art store, artist studio, or all of the above. As well, a cairn commemorating the work of Maurice Haycock will be built by a small group of the artists at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island in close proximity to one built by Dr. Haycock in 1969 in recognition of his friend and painting companion A.Y. Jackson's most northerly painting location in 1927, the year they met. And finally, a documentary film by Janet and John Foster, Gemini Award Winning Film makers, will highlight the artists entire journey with a focus on the historic roots of the expedition, including Amundsen's successful navigation through the Northwest Passage. This documentary will draw attention to the area, the issues related to the arctic such as global warming, sovereignty issues and its sensitive and fragile environment.

The Arctic Quest Exhibition will travel to communities in Canada, the United States and Norway. Concurrent with the art exhibition, there will be outreach programs, screening of the documentary, art workshops for children, demonstrations of Inuit artistic skills and cultural crafts, and lectures. Inuit painting workshops will be given as part of the Ontario Lieutenant Governor's Twinning Initiative between the North and South. Two book launches will also bring attention to the historic work of the Geological Survey of Canada, plus early settlement by Inuit and exploration by Europeans in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Maurice Haycock's Diary of a year in the arctic in 1927, and Historic Sites in the Canadian Arctic.

The network covers the states of Usbekistan, Kirgistan and part of Kasachstan and has an extension of about 1.000 × 500 km. One point in the network (Kitab) is belonging to the global GPS fiducial station network, running permanently a ROGUE receiver. Another point (Maidanak) was tied to the nearby 3rd generation SLR station. By two joint teams the monumentation of the network was carried out in May/June 1992 following CSTG/SGMS monumentation standards. The first observation campaign was run in August 1992 by 11 joint teams equipped with TRIMBLE 4000 SST receivers, automatic meteo stations, generators, etc. Four corner points of the network were occupied permanently, the rest of the network was observed by seven moving teams in 6 sessions. First data analysis results have been obtained by processing the Trimble data from the regional network simultaneously with the global IGS core network data.

 al. 1990). In addition, !  using the techniques of Karl et
 al. (1988), NCDC generated temperature files in which the
 biases introduced by urbanization effects were removed.  The
 new revision 3 (Easterling et al. 1996) data represent the best
 available data from the United States for analyzing long-term
 climate trends on a regional scale and may be used for studies
 attempting to determine the climatic impacts of increased
 concentrations of greenhouse gases. The data for most stations
 extend through December, 1994, and a majority of the station
 records are complete for at least 80 years. Unlike many data
 sets that have been used in past climate studies, these data
 have been adjusted to remove biases introduced by station
 moves, instrument changes, time-of-observation differences, and
 urbanization effects.

Source and Scope of the Data:


One of the objectives in establishing the U.S. HCN was to detect
secular changes of regional rather than local
climate. Therefore, only those stations that were not believed
to be influenced to any substantial degree by artificial changes
of local environments were included in the network. Some of the
stations in the U.S. HCN are first order weather stations, but
the majority were selected from U.S. cooperative weather
stations (approximately 5000 in the United States). To be
included in the U.S. HCN, a station had to be active (in 1987),
have at least 80 years of mean monthly temperature and total
monthly precipitation data, and have experienced few station
changes. An additional criterion that was used in selecting the
1221 U.S. HCN stations, which sometimes compromised the
preceding criteria, was the desire to have a uniform
distribution of stations across the United States.  The 1221
station U.S. HCN database contains station histories, monthly
temperature (maximum, minimum, and mean) data, and total monthly
precipitation data that were compiled by NCDC after being
extracted from digital and nondigital data sets archived at
NCDC. These data sets originated from a variety of sources,
including climatological publications, universities, federal
agencies, individuals, and data archives. All stations were
quality controlled by NCDC with the use of outlier and areal
edits, and each station in the network was corrected for
time-of-observation differences, instrument changes, instrument
moves, station relocations, and urbanization effects (Karl et
al. 1986; Karl and Williams 1987; and Karl et al. 1988). A
unique feature of the data set is that, within most temperature
and precipitation data files, both original and adjusted
estimates are given, along with confidence factors for each
adjusted estimate. Another unique feature of the database is
that in r!  elation to the long periods of record, a small
portion of the data are represented as missing. In order to make
the U.S. HCN record as serially complete as possible, missing
data have been estimated by using data from neighboring
stations. The majority of the 1221 stations have had data
records that are serially complete since 1900; where serially
complete is defined as having original or adjusted data
available for all months after the reported serially complete
date for a given station.

Applications of the Data:

The U.S. HCN database represents the best monthly temperature
and precipitation data set available for the contiguous United
States. It provides an accurate, serially complete, modern
historical climate record that is suitable for detecting and
monitoring longterm climatic changes on a regional scale and may
be used for studies attempting to determine the climatic impacts
of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. The U.S. HCN
climate record may also be used by dendrochronologists and
paleoclimatologists for calibrating tree ring growth, pollen,
and marine plankton data or by those studying the climatic
impacts of periodic events such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation
or volcanic eruptions. Those studying longterm climatic changes
on smaller scales, may want to review the information given in
the appendices in order to identify the stations most suitable
for their research needs.

Scientific Objectives:
This program will study the
 -biological sources of atmospheric chemicals
 -global distribution and long-range transport of chemical species
 -reactions in the troposphere that lead to the conversion, redistribution, and
  removal of atmospheric chemicals
Project Description:
The National Academy of Sciences in 1984 recommended initiation of a Global
Tropospheric Chemistry Program (GTCP), in recognition of the central role of
tropospheric chemistry in global change.  The resources required are
distributed among several federal agencies, scores of universities, and a
variety of scientific disciplines-- including atmospheric science, biology,
land processes, and oceanography.  NASA's contribution to the GTCP is the
Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE), which utilizes large, extensively
instrumented aircraft, along with satellite observations of meteorology, land
use, and atmospheric chemical species to aid in experiment design and in the
scientific analysis of results obtained from aircraft and ground-based
measurements.
The first series of projects carried out under the GTE was the Chemical
Instrumentation Test and Evaluation (CITE) projects which exposed instruments
aboard aircraft to a wide range of conditions in both polluted and and
clean-air settings.  CITE-1 was conducted in 1983 and consisted of a
ground-based experiment at Wallops Island, Virginia and aircraft-based over
California, southwestern U.S. and the central Pacific Ocean.  CITE-2 was
conducted in 1986 over California and the eastern Pacific, and CITE-3 was
conducted in 1989 over Wallops Island, Virginia and the tropical Atlantic off
the coast of Brazil. The advanced instruments validated by CITE have been used
to carry out GTE field measurements.
The initial field expeditions, the Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE)
projects, were designed to probe the interactions between the biosphere and the
atmosphere.  They measured the fluxes of gases between the surface and the
atmospheric boundary layer (the tropospheric layer in direct contact with the
surface) and the mixing of gases from the boundary layer into the 'free
troposphere' above. The ABLE-1 experiment was conducted in 1984 over the
tropical Atlantic from a base in Barbados; ABLE-2 was conducted in 1985 and
1987 over the Amazon region; ABLE-3 was conducted in 1988 and 1990 over Alaska
and northern Canada.
Future experiments scheduled for the early 1990's include: the Transport and
Chemistry in the Atlantic (TRACE-A) which will investigate the distribution of
atmospheric trace gases over the tropical Atlantic; also the Pacific
Exploratory Mission (PEM) which will study atmospheric chemistry over the
Pacific Basin.
Data Used and Produced:
GTE is primarily a aircraft-based program supplemented by ground-based
measurements.  The aircraft include the NASA Convair-990 and the Electra.
Space Shuttle, Landsat, and the NOAA weather satellites are also being
utilized.  Global observations from space will ultimately be the technique of
choice for mapping the distributions of reactive, spatially variable chemical
species.  Aircraft measurements will eventually provide 'ground truth' for
satellite measurements and explore in detail the processes responsible for the
observed distributions.
The Public Archive of data collected on the NASA/GTE program consists of data
from the CITE-1 Wallops Intercomparison Test in 1983 through the Amazon
Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE-2B) in 1987.  These data are stored on various
media including IBM-PC compatible diskettes, VAX 9-track tapes, tabular paper
listings, plots, videos and other film products, as well as weather charts and
summaries.

monoxide, nitric oxide, hydroxyl radical, hydrocarbons, non-methane
hydrocarbons, sea salt, and ultraviolet flux, along with wind, temperature, and
dew point.
2. CITE-2 data: species measurements of carbon monoxide, ozone, nitric oxide,
nitrogen dioxide, reactive nitrogen, nitric acid, and peroxyacetyl nitrate.
3. ABLE-1 data: species measurements of ozone, aerosols, carbon monoxide,

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This project links together multidisciplinary interests in the region of West Antarctica where the ice sheet discharges into the Amundsen Sea. It is one of the most active ice sheet areas, is already contributing a significant fraction of the increasing sea level, and holds the potential to dwarf other sea level contributions in the future. Aside from routine satellite coverage that monitor elevation and surface features, information about the area is limited. Our project will greatly advance our knowledge of ice dynamics of the area, the basal conditions, sub-shelf oceanic interactions, atmospheric transport of incoming snow, and historical record of ice extent. These studies will be conducted with the direct intention of supplying the involved modeling experts with necessary data to construct, initialize and validate advanced full-stress tensor models of ice flow.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The main aim of the study is to reach a better understanding of the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua). The main colonies of gentoo are on the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and Kerguelen Islands; smaller populations are found on Macquarie Island, Heard Islands, South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. The key problems to be solved are the problems of the analysis of genetic variability and genetic structure of populations, the level of genetic diversity, the problems of adaptation to Antarctic environment and ecological impact on genetic structure of populations. We are planning to investigate populations of gentoo from the most southern to the most northern with several intermediate groups. Birds will be weighted, measured and blood samples will be collected. The analysis of progeny number per nest will be carried out also; this parameter for tourist-visited and non-visited populations will give some figures on tourism impact on gentoo reproduction. The main objectives of this project are: 1. To evaluate the level of phenotypic and genotypic variability. 2. To study the genetic structure of penguins' populations. 3. To estimate genetic and phenetic differences between populations and between the two subspecies (P. p. ellsworthii and P. p. papua). In addition, we also intended to: 1. Measure possible genotype-phenotype correlation. 2. Investigate the genotype-dependent level of environmental impact on instability of genome and instability of individual development. 3. Evaluate the impact of tourism on breeding success by comparing visited and non-visited populations. The average levels of heterozygosity, polymorphism and the number of alleles per locus will be calculated as parameters of genetic variability. The data on frequencies of alleles and genotypes will be obtained for each studied population. It will help to ascertain the genetic structure of populations and calculate genetic distances among populations. The following populations may be studied: Islands: Petermann, Wiencke, Livingston, Signy, Falklands, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands. We intend to collect data from tourist-visited and non-visited nestings. Existing data suggest the little or non significant effect of disturbing gentoo populations by tourist groups on breeding performance. Nevertheless, the human impact on population may cause changing its gene pool.

Paleoclimatic research indicates that processes and conditions in polar regions play a large role in driving and amplifying global climate variability at centennial to millenial time scales. The outstanding role of polar regions in the global climate system is currently evidenced by the distinct warming of polar regions (e.g. Arctic realm, Antarctic Peninsula) that exceed modern warming on a global scale. Polar processes and conditions include biological cycling and physical circulation in the polar oceans, the formation and distribution of sea ice, the behavior of permafrost areas, atmospheric circulation and transport of water vapor, and the volume and stability of continental ice. Polar and subpolar High-Nutrient-Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) areas may act as CO2 sinks during glacial periods when the increased input of the micronutrient, iron, stimulates primary production. The extent and the seasonal variability of sea ice influences the Earth's albedo, water mass production, heat and gas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, and biological productivity. Melt water pulses, which alter surface ocean density gradients, may induce rapid climate change. The impact of such environmental events in the Arctic Ocean, North Atlantic, and Southern Ocean may propagate globally via ocean circulation, through the operation of the "bipolar seesaw". New data suggest a less stable Antarctic ice volume than generally presumed, even during cold periods, and shed new light on the vulnerability of the Antarctic ice sheets and their effect on global ocean circulation and sea level change. What is needed now is determined investigation of these diverse processes so a sophisticated picture of the power of polar regions to drive climate change can be assembled.

The international and multidisciplinary effort within the proposed BIPOMAC network will generate the coordinated, broad-ranging influx of knowledge necessary to clarify the intertwined roles of bipolar ice, ocean, and atmospheric processes in climate evolution and sea level change at different operational modes of the bipolar climate machinery. This wave of knowledge will come from carefully selected marine and terrestrial records covering the Pliocene to Holocene from both polar regions. This will also include records from areas that have to date been sparsely investigated, if at all (central Arctic Ocean, Arctic Pacific, NE Siberia, Antarctic Pacific, Antarctic ice shelf). The better understanding of the polar systems will substantially increase our ability to forecast future climate and sea level change, and help us focus our responses to the environmental challenges that we will be facing.

The BIPOMAC network combines: 

(1) Process studies to clarify mechanisms of polar sediment deposition and alteration and quantify the impacts on paleoenvironmental proxies. These studies include that of polar land to ocean sediment transfer, sediment and particle fluxes in the polar seas and lakes, and the paleoecological implications of an experiment in the Scotia Sea to test iron addition as a means for CO2 sequestration.

(2) Paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on well-dated northern and southern polar paleoceanographic, paleolimnological, terrestrial fossil, and continental ice volume/extent records. Study intervals and areas include: 
(a) warmer-than-present Pliocene and Pleistocene intervals from the Canadian Arctic (Beaver Pond, Bylot Island), the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean and expected from NE Siberia (El' gygytgyn) and Antarctic near-shore drillsites (ANDRILL); 
(b) Pleistocene glacial/interglacial cycles from shelf/coastal lowland permafrost and lake deposits of NE Siberia (e.g. Lake El´gygytgyn), North Greenland terrestrial records and from Patagonian/South American lake sediments; and marine deposits from the continental margin and deep Arctic Ocean, the Arctic and Subarctic Pacific, Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, North Atlantic, the Indian, Atlantic (Scotia Sea) and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean including near-shore studies in the areas of Prydz Bay, the Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea (e.g. McMurdo Sound); 
(c) the Late Glacial and Holocene documented in terrestrial, permafrost and/or lake deposits from a large variety of locations in the Canadian and Russian Arctic, NE Siberia and Kamtchatka, on Svalbard, Southern Ocean islands and in Antarctic coastal areas (e.g. Prydz Bay) together with marine deposits from the Arctic continental shelf and margin, the Arctic Pacific, Bering Sea and Sea of Okchotsk, the Indian, Atlantic (Scotia Sea) and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean. 

(3) Numerical modeling of ice-atmosphere-ocean processes to decipher the complex pathway and timing of climate development, its internal amplification and propagation mechanisms (ice/ocean/atmosphere), and the effect of external forcing (insolation/solar activity).

The BIPOMAC network also includes projects for the development of innovative methods for the enhancement of paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on diatom biomarkers and stable isotopes of biogenic opal and associated organic matter, and the increase in the accuracy of dating with the radiocarbon method in polar, low-carbonate sediments.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The evolution of glaciers is one of the important indicators selected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to locate the variability and climate trends during the last century. Glaciers are now a key climate indicator for the past and for the future.

GLACIOCLIM aims to build a database of glacial weather over the long term in order to:

1) Examine the relationship Climate-Glacier that is to say, understanding the relationships between climatic variations and glacial mass balance (flow analysis of mass and energy between the atmosphere and the glacier).

2) Predicting the future evolution of glaciers in terms of water resources, contribution to the future rise in sea level and other impacts related to the nature of glaciers.

3) Understanding the dynamic response of glaciers (variations in thickness, length, velocity) fluctuations in mass balance study and natural hazards of glacial origin. Mechanisms of glacier flow are still unknown to a large extent.

several near polar orbiting, sun synchronous satellites monitoring the

DMSP satellites are in a near polar orbiting, sun synchronous orbit at
an altitude of approximately 830 Km above the earth. Each satellite
crosses any point on the earth up to two times a day and has an
orbital period of about 101 minutes thus providing nearly complete
global coverage of clouds every six hours.

Each DMSP satellite monitors the atmospheric, oceanographic and
solar-geophysical environment of the Earth. The visible and infrared
sensors collect images of global cloud distribution across a 3,000 km
swath during both daytime and nighttime conditions. The coverage of
the microwave imager and sounders are one-half the visible and
infrared sensors coverage, thus they cover the polar regions above 60
degrees on a twice daily basis but the equatorial region on a daily
basis. The space environmental sensors record along track plasma
densities, velocities, composition and drifts.

intended to address complex issues relating to the global carbon cycle
by contributing to the understanding of factors that regulate rates of

a cooperative program with funding from a number of federal agencies
including Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Commerce/NOAA,
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, NASA, and the
National Science Foundation (NSF).

The challenges for AmeriFlux are to; (1) extend surface-atmosphere CO2
flux studies in the spatial domain, producing a continental-scale data
base for evaluating the capacity of the terrestrial biosphere to
sequester carbon, (2) understand the analogous phenomena in a broad
range of major ecosystem types of potential importance in the global
carbon budget, (3) extend studies in the temporal domain to define the
impact of climate variation and climate change on carbon exchange
between the atmosphere and major biomes at decadal time scales, and,
(4) contribute to a global data base needed for global carbon cycle
model testing and validation. [from the AmeriFlux Science Plan]

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: ECOGREEN
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=122

The overall focus of the ECOGREEN consortium is to establish the scientific basis for a long-term ecosystem-based management of marine resources in West Greenland. The West Greenland society relies almost entirely on marine resources for industrial as well as subsistence utilisation. Today, the West Greenland marine ecosystem is very productive and sustains fisheries which contribute 95% of Greenland's total export value. The Greenland Marine ecosystem also sustains seals and whales who feed in the area during summer, and, from the entire North Atlantic, seabirds by the million find a critical winter habitat resource in the ice-free area. Human use of the West Greenland marine ecosystem presents a complex mosaic of small- and large-scale commercial fishing, as well as subsistence and recreational fishing and hunting. 

The Arctic marine environment is vulnerable to impacts of human activities and is of high climatic sensitivity. In the Arctic, greenhouse warming over the next century is predicted to be 2-4 times higher than at lower latitudes. Increased human impact on marine ecosystems combined with effects of global climate change heightens the need for sustainable ecosystem-based management. Today, knowledge of the interaction between climate change, natural resources, human behaviour, and governance structure is fragmentary. Consequently, the knowledge base for ecosystem management is inadequate. There is a need for co-ordination of research efforts to overcome the fragmentation of these diverse fields of enquiry. An integrated research approach is needed to develop models for sustainable ecosystem management.

The West Greenland marine ecosystem is an ideal model area for integrated studies of ecosystems, resources, and associated social factors, where general theory for ecosystem dynamics and ecosystem management can be developed and tested. Management systems must take into account the wishes and influences of diverse domestic users, science-based advice from national and international bodies, and the influence of national and international public opinion. Finally, ECOGREEN can serve as a model for integrated studies of ecosystems, resources, and associated social factors for indigenous people in other Arctic regions and form the basis for establishing a real decision support system.

Specific tasks will include:

Describing and improving the understanding of physical and bio-geo-chemical interactions through field observations and empirical, dynamic and predictive modelling with emphasis on 1) Climate change (atmosphere, ice, physical and bio¬logical oceano¬graphy) 2) Pelagic-benthic coupling 3) Lateral coupling (fjord, shelf and Deep Ocean) 

Quantifying and improving the understanding of the eco¬system structure and productivity with emphasis on 1) Biodiversity 2) Interactions and coupling between tropic levels, and 3) Spatial and temporal scales 

Identifying and describing the main social, economic and institutional drivers behind environmentally significant human behaviours with emphasis on 1) Fishing and hunting 2) Governance institutions and social interactions

Identifying and quantifying interactions between human activities and the ecosystem with emphasis on 1) Ecosystem impacts of hunting and fishing, including by-catch, discards, fish processing offal, habitat impacts of fishing gear, habitat disturbance or loss due to other human activities 2) Ecosystem impacts of other anthropogenic disturbances

Analysing the transfer of the West Greenland experiences to a generic approach for a sustainable ecosystem-based management with emphasis on 1) Reflections and operationalisation of the concept of ecosystem-based management and 2) Transfer of the West Greenland experiences to a generic approach for ecosystem management applicable into a broader Arctic context

  throughout North America, including Mexico and Canada. Its
  primary mission is to coordinate and enhance policy-relevant
  scientific research and assessment of tropospheric ozone
  behavior, with the central goal of providing the information
  needed for workable, efficient, and effective strategies and
  policies for local and regional ozone management. NARSTO
  provides cross-organization planning to set a prioritized
  research agenda and determine the most effective strategy for
  scientific investigation, coordinates member investments where
  they voluntarily take responsibility for all needed research
  activity, and conducts periodic assessments of scientific
  advances and progress toward fulfilling its goal. NARSTO
  sponsored field campaigns have already been completed int eh
  summers of both 1995 and 1996 by the Southern Oxidants
  Study. NARSTO-North East (NE), and NARS!  TO-NE coordinating
  with NARSTO-Canada East.

  In addition to coordinating funding for field research, NARSTO
  is currently preparing a State-of-Science Assessment that will
  comprehensively review advances in the chemical, physical, and
  meteorological science of tropospheric ozone. Throughout 1997,
  seventeen critical review papers will be prepared by experts in
  the relevant research areas. These will be presented at a NARSTO
  Science Symposium to be held in November 1997 and will also
  appear in a special issue of an air quality scientific
  journal. The Assessment Report, which will synthesize the review
  papers, is scheduled for completion by the end of December
  1998. It will address how recent scientific progress can be used
  to develop improved options for ozone management.

  U. S. Federal agencies participating in NARSTO include the
  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce (National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Administration), Energy (Office of Energy
  Research), the Interior, and Transportation, as well as
  independent agencies, such as the Environmental Protection
  Agency, the National Science Foundation, the National
  Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Tennessee Valley
  Authority.

  These agencies combine efforts with those of the air quality
  departments of several State governments, as well as private
  companies, to perform cooperative research and analysis of
  pertinent facets of the ozone management issue. Private sector
  participants include over 30 utilities, automotive, chemical,
  and other companies. In addition, numerous universities and
  private sector research organizations are NARSTO partners.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=91

Satellite observations are revolutionizing our ability to observe the poles and polar processes. No other technology developed since the IGY of 1957 provides the high-resolution, continental-scale, frequent-repeat, and all-weather observations available from spaceborne sensors. The utility of that technology is evidenced by associated scientific advances including measurements of long term trends in polar sea ice cover and extent, the realization that the polar ice sheets can change dramatically at decade or less time scales, and the quantification of relationships between processes at the poles and at mid and equatorial latitudes. There are many examples of successful spaceborne observations from pole to pole for scientific, commercial and governmental purposes. These successes encourage the use of the capabilities and consequently, the competition for access to resources from the international constellation of satellites becomes increasingly more intense. Frequently, this means that there are only limited opportunities for conducting large-scale projects that consume a significant fraction of system capabilities for some dedicated period of time. One example of a large-scale coordinated effort is the Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) that required months of dedicated satellite and ground support time to achieve its objective of obtaining near instantaneous snapshots of Antarctica to serve as gauges for measuring future changes. 

Large-scale coordinated-experiments will continue to be important for polar scientists seeking to understand the role of polar processes in climate change, the contribution of the polar ice sheet to sea level, ice sheet and ocean interactions, and the dynamics of ice sheets and sea ice. These future missions will be further enhanced if complementary observations and data analysis from different satellite sensors can be coordinated (for example: MODIS, MISR, IceSAT; RADARSAT1 and RADARSAT2 (currently operating, and to be launched in 2006, respectively); ALOS (launched in January 2006); TerraSAR-X (launch 2006); the new approved ESA Earth Explorer series: GOCE (launch tbc 2007) - SMOS (launch tbc 2007) - ADM/Aeolus (launch tbc 2008) together with: - Envisat (currently operating) - METOP (launch tbc 2006)). Complementary to these hemispheric-scale projects are short-term, focused data acquisition campaigns over several weeks in support of coordinated and intensive ground-based and suborbital instrument measurements of the polar cryosphere, as recently proposed to NASA by the Polar Gateways subgroup for an Antarctic high-altitude balloon flight of an ice sounding radar. But across the temporal and areal scale of observations, coordination is challenging in part because of resource allocation issues and in part because space programs are operated by a host of national and international agencies. To overcome those challenges, the international polar science community needs a common rallying point. 

We propose to develop an international science plan for coordinated spaceborne and in situ observation of the polar regions and polar processes as part of the proposed International Polar Year and as part of the IGOS-Cryosphere theme implementation. The goal is to advance polar science by obtaining another critical benchmark of processes in the Arctic and Antarctic during the IPY and to set the stage for acquiring future benchmarks beyond IPY. The technical objective is to coordinate polar observations with spaceborne and in situ instruments and then make the resulting data and derived products available to the international science community. Acquisitions must be tailored to concentrate on those science problems that would best be served by a focused, time limited data acquisition campaign and/or those problems that would be served by having a diverse but integrated set of observations. One possible expansion of this idea would be to include ice covered regions from pole to pole that are known to be important contributors to current sea level change. Another extension could focus on the polar ionosphere which impacts active radar sounding and communications for orbital satellites. A new interdisciplinary objective could be to integrate cryospheric and ionospheric measurements to maximize resolution of cryospheric structures and changes over time. Accomplishment of this objective requires coordination between cryospheric and ionospheric data archives, e.g. respectively the NASA-supported data facilities for the Earth Observing System and for Sun Solar System Connection (S3C). Our lead institutions are involved in EOS while the lead of the Polar Gateways group is Chief Scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for S3C.

The goal of this proposal is to develop the most effective mechanism by which to plan and synchronise IPY satellite acquisition data requests (ultimately resulting from approved IPY Projects) via an instrument such as a coordinated IPY ESA Announcement of Opportunity (AO), a NASA Research Announcement, and national consultation activities conducted by collaborating agencies. This is necessary in order to receive approval from participating organizations for required support of the IPY satellite data processing overhead, and is also needed in order to anticipate volumes of data, mission planning and data distribution demand. Furthermore, these may be needed to secure remote sensing data needs in advance of requests for funding from the appropriate National or EU funding bodies. Due to the anticipated volume of IPY data acquisition requests, it may be important to consider establishing and IPY interdisciplinary coordination or satellite data acquisition planning group(s) to streamline and consolidate independent overlapping and/or complementary data requests. This will make the optimisation of the complex mission planning aspects more efficient.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Science Summary:
The aim of this research is to analyze the role of temperature, light, and nutrient availability in regulating primary production of arctic tundra ecosytems at several levels of ecological organization and at different time scales. The research is organized around three general hypotheses about the mechanisms reeulating adjustments of primary production in response to short- and long-term variation in climate. The basic idea is that different mechanisms control the responses to climate at different levels of ecological organization and at different time scales. In order to obtain useful predictions of the effects of climate change on primary production, a better understanding of relationships between these interacting mechanisms of adjustment to climate change is needed. To test the three general hypotheses, this five-year program of research will focus on an integrated series of field experiments in moist tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska. The mechanisms to be studied include those operating at the physiological level (e.g., photosynthesis), the whole-plant level (storage and recycling, changes in allocation and biomass turnover), the species and ecotype levels (constraints on nutrient use efficiency and growth rates), and the whole-ecosystem level (climate controls on soil nutrient supply). This project is part of International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). It is funded within the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program. Collaboration with other ecologist working at Toolik Lake and at other arctic sites as part of the Long-Term Ecological research (LTER) and Global Change in Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) programs will increase the application and impact of this research.

Logistics Summary:
This project will work at Toolik field station with a goal of analyzing the role of temperature, light, and nutrient availability in regulating primary production of arctic tundra ecosystems at several levels of ecological organization and at different time scales. Logistics support to include: dates - May 01 through August 31 332 total user days at Toolik (252 for ITEX, 80 for REU), 3 days helicopter support (per Williams &amp; Riseng) all other support provided by IAB.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=431

Northern regions are facing unprecedented rates of change from resource extraction, climate change, technological innovation, and population growth. Northern communities and governments wish to plan for the future by understanding changes and applying tools to manage them in an integrated way. The science of cumulative effects theorizes that ecological, social, and economic conditions respond to increasing doses of human-induced changes in ways that can be measured empirically. Dose-response curves provide a scientific framework to unify change measurement across disciplines. By examining responses along a continuum of landscape change, relationships between ecological, economic and social indicators can be developed. These dose-response curves can then be integrated into landscape models to evaluate trade-offs and identify practical options that optimize social, ecological, and economic outcomes. Such models help empower northern governments, aboriginal groups, and communities to understand and accept trade-offs associated with cumulative effects management. 
We have gathered a team with expertise and a performance record linking economic, social, and ecological responses to intensity of human development in northern communities. Comparative and integrated Arctic case studies will be conducted in Canada in the Southeast Yukon and Labrador. Ecological dose-response curves will be generated for our case study areas by surveying aquatic (water quality, benthic invertebrate and fish) and terrestrial (bird and mammal) communities along gradients of human activity. Social and economic dose-response curves will be generated using interviews to document community preferences along similar land use change gradients. These data will be used to generate predictive relationships between ecological, social and economic indicators and human activity using common dose-response methodologies. Spatial and aspatial cumulative effects models will be used to conduct informed trade-off analyses to illustrate the benefits and liabilities associated with different northern land use trajectories. Implementation schemes that support desired ecological and socio-economic outcomes and reflect existing structures will be developed. Our Canadian methodology is tied to comparative methodologies used by our international partners in Scandinavia and Russia. Through the European Water Directive, Sweden has committed to the collection of trans polar data using the reference condition approach to understand how aquatic communities respond to arctic development (Dr. RK Johnson, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences). The land use-land cover change project in northern Canada and eastern Russia (ARCTLANDS, Mr. Andrey Petrov EoI 338) will relate historical land use changes to social indicators of community well-being using common methodology, and to biodiversity indicators of ecological sustainability using a similar gradient approach across Scandinavia, eastern Europe and western Russia (Dr. Per Angelstam, Swedish Univ. Agricultural Sciences) . Studies are being undertaken in 70 areas in Finland to understand factors affecting the implementation and social acceptance of laws for conservation of biodiversity across landscapes (Dr. Mikael Hilden, Finnish Environment Institute). Our IPY integrated approach is based upon research we have conducted over the past 2 years under The Working Landscapes: Integrated Ecosystems Management Project of the Northern Ecosystems Initiative (NEI), funded by Environment Canada (see Section 3.1). 
Comparative analysis between our Canadian and international case studies will be used to understand the: 1) transferability of information on social and ecological impacts between northern regions; 2) extent to which impacts depend on the institutional and legal setting in which they are experienced; and 3) the relationship between resiliency of social and ecological systems and site context. The impact of management variables (e.g., scale of management area, demographic makeup of communities, duration of impacts) on the effectiveness of management systems will also be evaluated. We will leave a legacy of training on data collection and analyses so that northern communities can track outcomes as development progresses. This legacy will be implemented through Yukon College as well as the proposed NWT Environmental Sciences Centre of Excellence (EoI 697) and Legacy Research and Outreach Centre in the Yukon (EoI 700), and through technology transfer with the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (Activity No. 133). Results from our project will assist Northern Communities in developing effective regional resource management systems that take advantage of lessons learned elsewhere, while at the same time being responsive to critical site specific variables and features. The integrated framework provides a baseline of information about ecological and human responses to environmental change that can also be used to assess the impacts of climate driven changes on ecosystem variables.

Interactions Clouds Aerosols Radiations Etc

A data and expertise centre for atmospheric research For more than 40 years, satellites have been monitoring clouds, aerosols, solar radiation and the water cycle, providing researchers with vast amounts of data to sift through and analyse.

With the A-Train constellation of 5 Earth-observation satellites1 dedicated to studying the atmosphere and the water cycle, this stream of data is increasing. The Icare research structure aims to provide shared access to these data so that the scientific community can exploit them fully. 

Icare was set up in 2003 by CNES, CNRS2, INSU3 and USTL4, with backing from the Nord Pas-de-Calais Regional Council and the European Union, to create new momentum for the efforts of French laboratories studying atmospheric phenomena.

Icare manages products derived from A-Train data, as well as from previous missions like ScaRaB and Polder. It also processes data from weather satellites like Meteosat and MSG, which provide a broad spectrum of complementary observations. The Icare research structure’s dedicated Data Management and Processing Centre (DMPC), operational since 2005, is responsible for getting synthesis products quickly to scientists. The DMPC processes and distributes data, particularly to research centres working on clouds, aerosols, radiation and the water cycle.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Lake Ontario Winter Storms (LOWS; Reinking et al. 1993) project is an example of a wintertime field experiment where man–machine forecasting played an important role. The experiment was conducted between 5 January and 1 March 1990 over the Lake Ontario region. The main project objective was to improve forecasting of lake-effect snowstorms and freezing rain events over and near Lake Ontario. Guidance for field operations was provided by a lead forecaster at the NWS Forecast Office in Buffalo, New York, who worked with a project forecast committee. A lake snow outlook was provided four times daily. Data from ground-based project facilities as well as model output from a locally run version of the Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) Mesoscale Model version 4 MM4 were used to assist forecasters. The focus in LOWS was on precipitation and not on PBL development, and measurement facilities did not include aircraft. Thus, project forecasters did not explicitly have to target features like PBL depth or visibility so they could take advantage of existing statistical models and decision trees (e.g., machines) for lake-effect snow.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Developing Arctic Modelling &amp; Observing Capabilities for Long-term Env. Studies</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: DAMOCLES
Project URL: http://www.seaice.dk/damocles/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=40

The main objective of DAMOCLES is to reduce the uncertainties in our understanding of climate change in the Arctic and in the impacts thereof. To meet this objective DAMOCLES will, following the approach of Numerical Weather Prediction Centers, develop an integrated system for obtaining relevant geophysical observations, transferring them to a central databank, distributing them to the modelling centers, and producing nowcasts and forecasts of the Arctic climate. But since there exists no such thing as an Arctic Ocean Observing System, nor fully validated models for Arctic climate, nor accepted methods for forecasting of climate, a number of specific objectives need to be met in DAMOCLES: 

1. Synoptic observational coverage of the Arctic Ocean sea-ice cover 
The variability of sea-ice thickness, extent, concentration, ice-type and drift will be monitored by remote and in-situ systems in near real-time. Sea-ice dynamics and thermodynamics will be scrutinized to better understand their role for the large-scale ice-atmosphere-ocean system 
2. Synoptic observation and investigation of atmospheric key processes 
Aimed at a better predictability of the Arctic weather and climate key processes are investigated in a combined observational/process-modelling effort: the effects of Arctic cyclone on sea-ice in terms of heat and moisture transport, an improvement of boundary-layer physics over ice and ocean, an improvement of the radiative transfers and its interaction with snow and sea-ice 
3. Synoptic observation of the Arctic Ocean circulation and key processes 
An observational system will be set up with the aim to improve the understanding of the large-scale circulation of the Arctic Ocean and its vertical and lateral exchanges as well as the communication between central basins and the shelves. New techniques will be used to assess synoptically the state of the ocean under the ice and the fluxes of heat, salt and volume across the boundaries.
4. Integration and assimilation of observations with large-scale models 
Model sensitivities will be investigated and performance be improved by model-model and model-data comparison, aiming at an improved predictability.
Observations will be enhanced by a set of assimilation activities to deliver re-analysed Arctic variables in time and space

To address the question of potential impacts of climate change in the Arctic the following specific objective of DAMOCLES can be formulated:

5. Assessment of impact on environment and humans 
The observationally supported model improvements, the model sensitivities and past ranges of variability will be combined with new field data. The aim is to evaluate improved predictability and its consequences, as well as the impact of projected changes on adaptation capabilities and vulnerability of the environment and human activities.

Exploitation and dissemination of the results are key elements of the project. Thus, a 6th specific objective is:
6.User-friendly return of information to the community
A website will be available; giving the community updated information about the state of the Arctic (e.g. real-time information of key atmospheric, ice and ocean variables) as well as information about the progress of the science of DAMOCLES. Education will be provided, through workshops and student scholarships. Results will be published, both in scientific journals and in the popular-scientific press. The PIs will generally make themselves available to the public to the best of their ability.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Data and Information Service</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The WDC for Glaciology, Boulder and the Electronic Geophysical Year (eGY) in collaboration with many others propose to host the IPY DIS described in the IPY Framework Document. The DIS will work closely with the Data Policy and Management Sub-Committee (Data Committee) and other data management bodies and observing networks to develop the IPY data and information policy and strategy. The DIS will then be the primary implementer of that strategy and policy recognizing that the strategy will need to evolve with the science needs and developments of IPY.
Although much will depend on the strategy that is developed, we envision the DIS as an overall data management consultant and coordinator and a central data portal for an internationally distributed data management system. The DIS will continue to establish close partnerships with data centers and organizations around the world to build on existing systems. We will also work with each specific IPY cluster to ensure appropriate centralized data description and distributed archiving. Regional or discipline-specific affinity centers coordinated by the DIS will facilitate appropriate data description and archive. For example the Frozen Ground Data Center at the WDC, Boulder is working closely with the permafrost cluster, while the proposed Arctic Peoples Observations Center (EoI 358) could coordinate community-based monitoring data. Other potential affinity centers based on our current partners could include Russian data, Chinese data, data for education and outreach, remote sensing data, geospatial data infrastructures (regional and global), paleoenvironmental data, marine biological data, bibliographic data, and others (a detailed spreadsheet is available on request). Many of these affinity centers will likely create their own means of access to the data. It is unrealistic for a central DIS to be the single or even primary means of access, but we would like to establish a means to automatically share metadata across the system through a common (perhaps XML-based) framework
Specific activities of the DIS could include:
Collection (automated, where possible) of catalog metadata for all IPY projects and provision of Web-based portals to all IPY data archived around the world.
Examination and implementation of data discovery tools and data presentation schemes such as an interoperable web-based map server to enhance data access through a Web portal (could include a locator map for all IPY projects). 
Identification of existing tools to facilitate data management, and build on those to meet the needs of the IPY community. For example, the Global Change Master Directorys (GCMD) metadata authoring tool, docBuilder, could be customized.
Serving as a focal point for cross-disciplinary data integration, especially across the natural and social sciences.
Creation of appropriate management tools for non-numerical data such as interview transcripts, photographs, and videotapes.
Collaboration with eGY to make data management best practices and principles available to researchers and agencies, via Web pages, workshops, and other channels.
Acting as a clearinghouse and facilitator for data management and integration issues that need research, discussion, and resolution.
Working with eGY to increase awareness of the value of data management for both numerical and non-numerical data.
Responsive service to the IPY research community regarding data management
The DIS will take advantage of existing data management infrastructures, organizations, and technologies such as National and World Data Centers, the Joint Committee for Antarctic Data Management (JCADM), the GCMD, virtual observatories, and the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure. This distributed system will allow for appropriate management of the various types of data including social science and physical science data, and analog collections. The distributed nature of the system will also encourage development of new and experimental data access methods, including data mining technology and innovative data presentation methods that facilitate data integration. 
It is essential, however, to ensure ready and equitable access to and effective long-term preservation of the data. The DIS will assist distributed archives in adhering to sound data management principles and best practices as defined by the Data Committee, eGY, CODATA, WCRP CliC, JCADM, our partners, and other entities. We will ensure that these principles build upon existing international standards such the Open Archival Information System Reference Model and the ISO19115 metadata standard. The DIS will take advantage of emerging shared resources in the geosciences community, such as the effort to develop an international geophysical sample number (IGSN). In addition, the DIS could assist data providers in addressing human subjects protections and confidentiality issues for social science data and for other types of geo-referenced data.

NACP Project Profile http://www.nacarbon.org/cgi-nacp/web/investigations/inv_pgp.pl?pgid=44


In this study we are combining the USFS FIA and Landsat information sources to characterize recent trends in North American forest disturbance and regrowth. Initial projects by this team have shown that the basic patterns of disturbance can be evaluated using change detection methods and that regrowth can be evaluated from inferences of forest structural change noted by spectral reflectance changes. Collaboration with the US Forest Service has provided important access to Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data that permit direct comparison of the satellite-based spectral reflectance patterns with ground-based forest structural attributes. Finally, our capacity to process large volumes of Landsat satellite data has been demonstrated by a series of recent projects (REALM, LEDAPS). 

We will employ a statistically robust sampling system to select ~25 Landsat WRS locations within the coterminous US to conduct compartive Landsat/FIA analysis of recent disturbance and regrowth patterns. In addition, we are collaborating with our Canadian colleagues as they pursue similar analyses in their country. Combined, these analyzes will provide a continental-scale assessment of North American forest dynamics from 1972 to present. 

A dense biennual time-series of Landsat imagery 1972-2005) are being assembled for each lselected ocation. From these data the spatio-temporal trends in disturbance and regrowth, as will as their relation to driving variables (climate, management regime, etc) will be extracted. The combination Landsat-observed temporal spectral trajectories canopy reflectance modeling, , and plot-level FIA data, will be used to evaluate the diversity in regrowth dynamics that occur on this continent.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=153
Marine Mammal Exploration of the Oceans Pole to Pole (MEOP) will deploy state-of-the-art animal-borne CTD tags on strategically chosen, deep-diving marine mammal species to explore their movement patterns, behaviour and habitat utilization in Polar Regions. Concomitant with the ecological data regarding these top predators, a vast, high-precision oceanographic data set will be collected covering logistically difficult areas of ocean in Polar Seas at the fringes of the North and South Atlantic and the South Pacific that are strategically important to climate and ocean modelling. The cross-disciplinary merging of classical oceanography and marine mammal ecology will significantly advance our understanding of the world's oceans and top predators that live in them.


MEOP partners will deploy CTD-tags on beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), hooded seals (Cystophora cristata), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) and southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). Most of these species are very deep divers, with maximum dive depths that exceed 1000 m. Virtually all marine mammals forage in oceanic "hot-spots" where productivity is high, which also coincide with human fisheries efforts and areas of high oceanographic interest. Our target species inhabit areas with significant seasonal ice-cover in both the Arctic and the Antarctic, the edges of which are of particular interest to oceanographers in terms of deep-water formation. Ice-filled waters are rarely sampled by standard oceanographic studies using ships or other methodologies especially over extended times because of logistical and cost constraints, but they are routinely visited by these polar marine mammals. MEOPs oceanographic data will also ehance our ability to accurately model currents and deal with basin scale models.

IPY affords a unique opportunity to collect novel data sets from relatively little-known polar marine mammal species simultaneously with dedicated oceanographic cruises sampling along systematic grids using traditional ship-based CTD technology. Co-operation between biological and oceanographic programmes within IPY will provide MEOP with comprehensive, synoptic oceanographic coverage that will provide a unique opportunity to quantify factors determining habitat selection and use by key polar marine mammal species. The oceanographic data collected in MEOP will, in turn, provide otherwise unobtainable oceanographic data sets collected at natural hot-spots of productivity, as input data to physically-oriented modelling projects (e.g. the Bipolar Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation Programme, Transport through gaps across the Kerguelen Plateau andinter-basin exchange).

This study is especially timely given the predictions for ecosystem changes in both Arctic and Antarctic systems within the coming decades due to climate change, in addition to increasing fisheries and tourism activities in both the Arctic and Antarctic.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
Over large regions of the globe, fires are known to contribute
significantly to the injection of gases and aerosols into the
atmosphere, and to be a major disturbance to the vegetation cover.
Biomass burning contributes up to 50%, 40% and 16% of the total
emissions of anthropogenic origin for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide
and methane respectively.  Both the scientific community and the
policy makers are looking for reliable and quantitative information on
the magnitude and spatial distribution of biomass burning

It is in this context that the Global Burnt Area 2000 initiative
(GBA2000) has been launched by the GVM Unit of the JRC, in partnership
with 6 other institutions, with the specific objective being to
produce a map of the areas burnt globally for the year 2000, using the
medium resolution (1 km) satellite imagery provided by the
SPOT-Vegetation system and to derive statistics of area burnt per type
of vegetation cover.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An air-sea-ice interaction experiment was conducted in the eastern Bering Sea during late February and early March 1981. Observations of the atmospheric surface layer were made from a buoy anchored 100 km seaward of the ice edge, from a ship steaming in the marginal ice zone (MIZ), and from an instrumented tower erected 100 km into the ice pack. During typical off-ice wind conditions the atmospheric surface layer was found to warm and accelerate with passage over the MIZ. Observations of the atmospheric boundary layer made from sondes launched from the ship in the MIZ showed a gradual warming and rising of the mixed layer with off-ice winds. Oceanic profiles of density and temperature conducted from the ship indicated a homogeneous column seaward of the ice edge, a two-level system under the MIZ with a mixed layer of oceanic water lying below a cooler, fresher lens of water beneath the ice and a homogeneous column north of the MIZ. Near-surface current meter profiles conducted from the within-pack station verified the presence of a sub-ice logarithmic boundary layer. Wind tower and current meter measurements generated estimates of air and water drag coefficients for the ice of 3.09 × 10 at 10 m and 14.7 × 10 at 2 m, respectively. The ice floes in the vicinity of the station were tracked for about 2 weeks until they reached the ice edge and melted. Tidal forces were seen to be an important component in the motion of ice floes. Floes were also observed to accelerate as they approached the ice edge.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ASGAMAGE

Air Sea GAs Marine Aerosol and Gas Exchange (ASGAMAGE) was an EU
MAST-3 project with ship time contributed by the NERC ACSOE project as
part of its MAGE component.

The objectives of ASGAMAGE were:

To find relationships between the transport coefficients for
the gas fluxes and any relevant geophysical parameters.

To test new methods and new equipment for the measurement of
air-sea fluxes of CO2, DMS and other gases.

To intercompare different methods and systems to measure the
transfer velocity of trace gases over the sea.

To find out whether and, if at all, under what conditions
there can be a significant vertical gradients in the carbon dioxide
concentration in the upper metres of the water column

The field experiments were carried out in May and October 1996
at and around the Meetpost Noordwijk research platform (9 km off the
Dutch coast). During the second period the UK research vessel

RRS Challenger operated in the vicinity of the platform. The
instrument platform was heavily instrumented collecting oceanographic,
atmospheric and meteorological parameters thus:

The instruments on the west boom were concerned with the
measurement of gas transfer velocities using the eddy correlation
technique.

The Challenger cruise was primarily concerned with the field
measurement of air-sea gas transfer velocities using double
(SF6/3He) and triple(SF6/3He/bacterial spores) tracers
and the collection of basic oceanographic and meteorological data.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">CLIMATE CHANGE</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Climate change in the Arctic with special emphasis on Alaska</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The climate of Alaska has changed substantially over the last 100 years for which direct observations are available. For the last 50 years reliable data are available, while before this time calibration of the instrumentation was spotty, and major breaks in the observations have occurred. During the last 50 years the temperature in Alaska increased by some 3°F (Stafford, Wendler and Curtis 2000, Theoretical and Applied Climatology 67, 33-44), which is about 6 times the worldwide rate of about 1°F per century. This increase varied both in place and time, and seasonally, winter showed the largest increase followed by spring. The temperature increase was not steady over the 50 years; in the mid-seventies a strong temperature increase was observed (Hartmann and Wendler 2005, Journal of Climate, in press). Since then the temperature has not increased, with the exception of the North Slope. This strong, sudden temperature increase indicates that it is due to a circulation change, and at least not directly caused by increased greenhouse gases. We plan to further investigate the climate change, not only for mean values, but also for extremes.
Sea ice has decreased in the Southern Beaufort Sea and a good correlation between sea ice concentration and mean annual temperatures of coastal station was observed (Wendler, Moore, Curtis and Stuefer 2002, Proceedings of the 16th IAHR International Symposium, 202-210). This decrease in the sea ice leads to more open water, and during stormy periods, more erosion of the coastline occurs due to more wave action resulting from a longer fetch. There are further some indications that storminess has increased. The increased erosion rate is of great importance for villages at the North and west coast of Alaska, Shishmaref being the most prominent one, but for sure not the only one. We plan to investigate the relationship between temperature, sea ice, storminess and erosion. The surface energy budget for different ice concentration and ice types are proposed to be studied during a cruise in the Arctic Ocean jointly with our Russian colleagues.
The observed temperature increase has resulted also in glacier retreat. The mass balance of a glacier is the result of solid precipitation and the melting in summer due to temperatures above the freezing level. Most of the glaciers, and the largest in sice are found in the southern Alaska (Bering and Malaspina Glaciers, Juneau and Harding Ice Fields), where the temperature is much warmer than in the northern Alaska, however, the snow fall is also much higher by a factor of 10. The retreat is especially large in the Brooks Range, where the temperature increase was accompanied by a decrease in precipitation (Curtis Wendler Stone Dutton 1998, International Journal of Climatology 18, 1687-1707). McCall Glacier, studied since the IGY, is a typical example. We propose to investigate the glacier behavior in each of the 3 major mountain ranges as function of the climatic change observed since IGY. There is a good background of selected glaciers since IGY on which our study will concentrate.

The San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Study (SJVAQS)was performed by the
California Air Resources Board and various other public agencies,
private organizations, and universities. Sponsors included the
U.S. EPA, California Air Resources Board, Pacific Gas and Electric
Company. The study begin in 1986. There was &amp;#3617,000,000 in
funding for this project.

The SJVAQS is the core of these collaborative studies. The goals of
the SJVAQS are twofold: (1) provide an improved understanding of the
types of conditions that lead to high ozone concentrations in the
Valley, and (2) provide decision-makers with the information needed to
develop sound regional plans for equitable and effective emissions
controls.

The technical objectives include:

Characterizing Valley meteorology, the temporal and spatial patterns
and frequencies of ozone and precursor concentrations within the
Valley and surrounding areas,

Characterizing pollutant fluxes of ozone and precursors at locations
entering and leaving the Valley,

Characterizing the temporal and spatial distribution and amounts of
emissions from anthropogenic, biogenic, and geogenic sources,

Developing source-receptor relationships to improve understanding of
transport and atmospheric processes influencing air quality in the
Valley, and

Developing and specifying modeling and data analysis approaches for
relating emissions and air quality.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: MERSAM
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=439

Mercury (Hg) in the arctic has received considerable attention since several investigations have shown an increase in Hg concentration in various biota samples, including marine mammal tissues and seabird eggs which were mainly enriched in methylmercury (MeHg). These relatively high concentrations of Hg represent an important health issue for the rural indigenous native arctic communities consuming these products. The distribution of Hg in the top level of the arctic food web is well mirrored by the concentration of Hg in seabird eggs, where spatial differences exist between the Alaskan and Canadian arctic, with a marked Hg increase observed since 1975 in the Canadian arctic and distinct Hg signatures that are measured between seabird colonies residing in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, signatures that are subject to an apparent year-to-year variability and species specific effects. These spatial and temporal patterns as well as the levels of Hg in the food web prompt several fundamental questions on the nature of the sources of Hg that need to be answered through research, namely relative anthropogenic/natural contributions of Hg throughout and across ecosystems, the processes driving these patterns (i.e., sources, atmospheric transport and deposition, ocean currents, and evolution of the food web structure), their linkages and their respective contributions over time. 
All these processes need to be assessed on a spatial scale (considering arctic and sub-arctic regions) as well as on a temporal scale to evaluate the amplitude of these factors over time. In the absence of extensive Hg atmospheric monitoring stations in Alaska and also considering the variability and scarcity of data on Hg and MeHg levels in snow and seawater in Alaska, no direct temporal and spatial approaches can be conducted. In this proposal we utilize an indirect approach consisting of: 
(1) Tracking the sources of Hg and assessing regional differences by analyzing seabird eggs and feathers collected on a regular basis at several locations in the North American arctic and sub-arctic regions. These samples are archived at the Marine Environmental Specimen Bank (Charleston, SC, USA) administrated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), at the Canadian Wildlife Service Specimen Bank (Ottawa, ON CANADA) and are housed in various collections curated by University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Museum of the North and independent UAF researchers.
(2) Assessing the long-term temporal trend of Hg in the top marine food web using time series of collections of seabird eggs and feathers.
The spatial and retrospective approaches for monitoring Hg and MeHg in the samples will be coupled with several other sources of information including food web tracers (C and N stable isotopes ratios), as well as tracers of atmospheric transport/sources such as lead isotope ratio patterns in seabird eggs and feathers, and organic contaminant patterns in seabird eggs. Alone, all these data are valuable, but the power exists to collectively investigate the spatial/temporal relationship existing between the nature of Hg sources, their geographical extent and their accumulation/transfer in the arctic/sub-arctic foodweb.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Instituto Antártico Argentino was created under the Decree Nº 7338 on April the 17th 1951. Its founder and first director was the colonel Hernán Pujato. The goal of this creation was the need of a specialized organism to orientate, control, address and perform scientific and technical research and studies concerning this region, in coordination with the Comisión Nacional del Antártico, an institution depending on the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Stations set up at Marguerite Bay, Hope Bay, and Filchner Ice Shelf, and scientific summer seasons were the support for these goals, including a wide range of earth, sea and air sciences. On January the 26th, 1956, the Internal Rules of the Instituto Antártico Argentino are established. These Rules fix the scientific and technical nature of the institution. The Instituto Antártico Argentino becomes a dependency of the Navy Ministry, and doctor Rodolfo N. M. Panzarini (1956-57)(1958-68), Rear-admiral, Doctor on oceanography and Professor at Universidad de Buenos Aires, is designed Director. Since this time, the Instituto Antártico Argentino participated in several international scientific events, as the International Geophysic Year (1957-58) and the International Quiet Sun Year (1964-65). From 1958 to 1963, the Institute managed Ellsworth Station, Weddell Sea, transferred by USA after the International Geophysic Year. In 1964, Brown base, Paradise Bay, was incorporated as a permanent scientific station. In 1970 the Dirección Nacional del Antártico, a dependency of the Ministry of Defense, was created. The new institution had administrative and logistic functions and included the Antarctic Institute as the scientific organism with three departments: Science, Technique, and Scientific Exchange. In this time, twenty-one programmes were performed, including earth sciences, biological sciencies, and atmosphere sciences, in coordination with other national and international institutions. During the 80´s, the old shelter located at Potter cove, 25 de Mayo (King George) island, was incorporated, and became latter Jubany Base, where Dallmann laboratory operates. Dallmann laboratory is the only one in Antarctida to be operated in cooperation between two countries: Germany and Argentina. Research on biological and earth science fields is carried out at this laboratory. In 2003, under the Decree Nº 207/2003 issued by the Executive Power of Argentina, the Dirección Nacional del Antártico and the Instituto Antártico Argentino became a part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Cult. Accordingly to the principles of its creation, the Instituto Antártico Argentino, as a part of Dirección Nacional del Antártico, participates at present, with its scientific, technical and administrative staff, in a wide range of national and international programmes for a better understanding of the Antarctic.

Since the early 1970s oil and gas development has gradually come to dominate the industrial sector in the Arctic. The pace of development has increased significantly in recent years as the price of oil and gas has risen, motivating industry to travel further north to extract fossil fuels for global consumption. Increasing pressure from various governments - Russian, Norwegian, Canadian and Americans - require the Arctic to be open for business. Increasingly, Arctic communities are being tied into the global market for oil and gas, putting pressure on their individual and societal capacities to cope with change, participate in resource management decision-making, and secure any possible economic and social benefits. As such, the urgent pace of such development poses critical challenges to the human security of communities, affecting local economies, traditional livelihoods, health, food, and the environment. At the same time traditional securities are increasing in pressure from sovereignty issues to reducing dependencies upon Middle East oil and gas supplies.
A growing body of research and policy work on human security already exists [UNDP, 1994; Canada, 2005; Hoogensen, 2005]. However, little work to date has been conducted on the unique challenges to human security in the Arctic context. Human security attempts to recognize the (in)securities of human beings in a variety of contexts, ranging from health and food security to identity, economic and environmental securities. Oil and gas development from a securities perspective can be seen both positively and negatively, exposing Arctic communities to threats as well as opportunities. This framework provides a vehicle for the expression of vulnerabilities and adaptabilities from the grassroots level, such that individuals and communities themselves can determine what is important to their own sense of security. The need for such comprehensive, participatory research on the impacts of oil and gas development in Arctic communities has been well articulated (AHDR 2004; ACIA 2005; AIL 2005; AIP 2005; ICARP II 2005).
This timely research seeks to understand how oil and gas development impacts the security of Arctic communities, both for themselves as well as in relation to more traditional state-based securities requiring access and exploitation of resources. GAPS is a multidisciplinary project, joining social and natural scientists together, along with participating local communities and organizations, to gather and analyze data on oil and gas development in the Arctic region using a multiple securities approach. The project explores a number of the traditional and human security and environmental relationships in the Arctic and demonstrates the importance of the region to the development of security concepts in relation to environmental change.
Research project objectives:
Expand upon current understandings of human and traditional/state securities in the Arctic and their linkages to climate change;
Explore the meaning of security in Arctic communities and develop an understanding of the factors contributing to (in)securities as they are identified by community members;
Consider how local knowledge exposes (in)securities that have been thus far neglected or overlooked by scientific and policy communities;
Explore new potentials for local adaptabilities previously overlooked by research and policy communities;
Assess the interrelationships between major processes of change in the Arctic (including climate, societal, economic, ecological) and their combined impacts on human security in the region;
Explore new possibilities for community engagement in research in the Arctic and further strengthen university-community research linkages;
Facilitate communication and collaboration between circumpolar communities;
Develop grassroots indicators and methods to assess the impacts of oil and gas development on human security in the Arctic;
Employ innovative methods of data collection and research dissemination (i.e. film and video) to facilitate community access to, and involvement in, the research; and,
Provide the basis for Masters and PhD thesis research for participating graduate students.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), headquartered at Dalhousie University unites leading ocean scientists around the globe. The OTN is conducting the world's most comprehensive and revolutionary examination of marine life and ocean conditions, and how they are changing as the earth warms. 

OTN is a new global standard for ocean research. The world's climate is changing — of this we are sure. Marine life survival is becoming uncertain due to overfishing and changing migration patterns. Animals such as polar bears are becoming visibly anxious as their habitats begin to melt. Oceans are becoming warmer; the polar ice cap is melting. The alarming thing is that we don't really know why. Information from beneath the sea's surface is very limited, despite the fact that continued human survival is directly linked to stable oceanic life.

OTN is a mega-science conservation project, that will put an end to this knowledge void. With it, thousands of marine animals around the world — from fish to birds to polar bears — will be tracked using acoustic sound waves. At the same time, we will be building a record of climate change — data that can be analyzed and then applied.

OTN will lead to a global standard for ocean management in a way never before possible.

The Subregional Cooperative Electric Utility, National Park Service
and Enviornmental Protection Agency Study (SCENES) was a major
long-term observational study conducted by several industry and
government groups to understand factors influencing atmospheric
visibility in the southwestern United States.  Routine measurements
were made to relate ambient aerosol concentrations and visibility.
Seasonally intensive measurements were made that can be used to
characterize regional transport of aerosols and to identify source
categories.  Data were obtained over almost 6 years at 11 locations.
Most of the routine measurements and external auditing were in place
at all observatories by mid-1984 and these measurements were
terminated or no longer contributed to the central data base after 30
September 1989.  The eleven SCENES observatories focused on the
national parks, monuments, and recreation areas that stretch from the
intersection of California, Arizona, and Nevada along the Grand Canyon
and into southern Utah.
Data from the Research on Operations Limiting Visual Extinction
(RESOLVE) and NPS observatories collected during the SCENES study
period have been included in the data base for comparison, but
observatories were not operated using SCENES protocols.  The RESOLVE
monitoring locations in California, which were operated in close
coordination with SCENES, are usually upwind of the SCENES sites under
the prevailing westerly flow, but could be downwind of the Los Angeles
Basin and the San Joaquin Valley, both of which are strong sources of
air emissions.  Smelters are clustered in southern Arizona and just
across the border in Mexico.  Power plants are spread across Arizona,
New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, and California.

 The Lake Michigan Ozone Study (LMOS) is a multi-year cooperative
 interstate and federal effort that is seeking a regional
 solution to the ozone nonattainment problem in the Lake
 Michigan area, which includes portions of Illinois, Indiana,
 Michigan, and Wisconsin. A key objective of LMOS is to provide
 the Lake Michigan States with a technically credible
 photochemical modeling system that can be used in developing a
 regional emissions control strategy. Initial efforts involved
 the conduct of a field program during the summer of 1991,
 analyses of the data collected in the field study, the
 development of gridded, day-specific emissions estimates for
 four ozone episodes, application of a prognostic model to
 provide meteorological inputs, adaptation of the Urban Airshed
 Model (UAM-V) to the study area, evaluation of model
 performance, and the conduct of model sensitivity studies. The
 EPA has approved usage of the LMOS modeling system for
 developing revisions to the SIPs for the fo!  ur Lake Michigan
 States.

 The Lake Michigan Ozone Control Program (LMOP) is also a
 cooperative interstate and federal effort that represents the
 regulatory continuation of LMOS. The initial goal of LMOP was to
 develop an effective regional control strategy that will provide
 for attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality
 Standard (NAAQS) by the statuatory dates, and to submit
 individual State Implementation Plans that reflect this regional
 strategy. The long-term goal is to provide a mechanism for the
 Lake Michigan States to work together to ensure successful
 implementation of the regional strategy, and if appropriate,
 revision of the regional strategy, to achieve attainment (and
 maintenance) of the NAAQS.

The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and the Canadian Wildlife Service, National Wildlife Research Center jointly coordinate the BBS program. 

In the mid-twentieth century, the success of DDT as a pesticide ushered in a new era of synthetic chemical pest control. As pesticide use grew, concerns, as epitomized by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring, regarding their effects on wildlife began to surface. Local studies had attributed some bird kills to pesticides, but it was unclear how, or if, bird populations were being affected at regional or national levels. Responding to this concern, Chandler Robbins and colleagues at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center developed the North American Breeding Bird Survey to monitor bird populations over large geographic areas.

Although most concerns over pesticide use in North America have subsided in recent decades, bird populations continue to be subjected to numerous widespread threats including habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, land-use changes, and other chemical contaminants. Today, the BBS continues to monitor bird populations across North America and informs researchers and wildlife managers of significant changes in bird population levels. If significant declines are detected, their causes can then be identified and appropriate actions taken to reverse them before populations reach critically low levels.

Project URL: http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/icecap
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=97

The subsurface character and boundary conditions for much of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) remain largely unknown although they are critical to ice sheet modeling and, therefore, our understanding of the EAIS's role in global climate and sea level change. The lack of existing information in key regions of the EAIS is a consequence of its remoteness and inaccessibility. The acquisition of these essential data can only be accomplished by long-range airborne surveys requiring a level of international collaboration and commitment of resources that has been unavailable to the scientific community for over 25 years.

We propose to coordinate an internationally collaborative program of long-range aero-geophysical survey, during the period of the IPY, over the historically inaccessible subglacial highlands and lowlands of East Antarctica. Our proposed survey will be managed collaboratively by scientists from the US, UK, Germany and Australia with the advice of an International Steering Committee (ISC) implemented via SCAR's scientific research program named Antarctic Climate Evolution (ACE, EoI #37). Funding for this project will be sought from the US National Science Foundation and the UK National Environmental Research Council. The aerogeophysical surveys will be accomplished over two field seasons using a US Naval Research Laboratory P-3 Orion aircraft operating out of McMurdo Station (EoI #256).

The survey targets will be focused on regions critical to understanding contemporary and previous ice sheet dynamics and change and include subglacial highlands and lowlands of Domes A and C beneath the central EAIS. The region of our proposed ice penetrating radar, lidar, gravity and magnetics survey include the enigmatic Aurora Subglacial Basin as well as the majority of the Gamburtsev, Vostok and Belgica subglacial highlands.

The deeply depressed Aurora Subglacial Basin is a region of considerable importance to the form and stability of ice in East Antarctica. It hosts a catchment many times larger than that of the Pine Island/Thwaites Glacier system of West Antarctica and satellite remote sensing has recently revealed dramatic ice surface lowering in the region. It is possible that ice discharge from the Aurora Basin dominates Antarctica's contemporary ice loss to the ocean.

The highlands of the central Antarctic Plate beneath Domes A and C of the EAIS currently support an extensive network of subglacial lakes and have been the nursery for paleo ice sheets at least since the early Oligocene separation of Australia and East Antarctica. It is possible that the Gamburtsev Mountains have been the most intensely and continuously glaciated crustal elements on Earth.

The specific objectives of these internationally coordinated surveys will be: 

1) to provide bedrock elevation, ice sheet thickness, surface elevation, surface accumulation, englacial structure, basal melt rates and thermal structure necessary for modeling ice sheet (and subglacial lake) evolution and future change; 

2) to constrain geothermal flux and determine the location, properties and connectivity of the subglacial sedimentary and hydrological units critical to understanding ice sheet evolution (and subglacial habitats); 

3) to characterize subglacial lithology, identify crustal boundaries and estimate crustal rebound for the central Antarctic Plate; and 

4) to identify any "preserved" glacial geomorphology and map fault scarps indicative of Cenozoic (or older) tectonic processes.

These objectives and target areas are of interest to a broad spectrum of disciplines within the international scientific community. The many collaborating investigators in this activity represent a broad sampling of expertise from glaciology, including both remote sensing and ice sheet modeling, as well as geology and geophysics. In addition to its primary focus of understanding the cryospheric evolution of the EAIS through support of ice sheet modeling, this work will contribute substantially to both Antarctic subglacial lake exploration (EoI #876) and knowledge of the enigmatic Gamburtsev Mountains (EoI #384).

This project will investigate climate change in East Antarctica, with the following goals:

    * Investigate climate variability in Dronning Maud Land of East Antarctica on time scales of years to a million years.
    * Establish spatial and temporal variability in snow accumulation over this area of Antarctica to understand its impact on sea level.
    * Investigate the impact of atmospheric and oceanic variability on the chemical composition of firn and ice in the region.
    * Revisit areas and sites first explored by traverses in the 1960’s, for detection of possible changes and to establish benchmark data sets for future research efforts.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=373

The International Permafrost Association Carbon Pools in Permafrost Regions (IPA CAPP) Project aims at quantifying, characterizing and modeling below-ground organic matter quantity and quality along ecoclimatic and edaphic gradients in high latitude and high altitude regions characterized by the presence of isolated to continuous permafrost. 

The CAPP Project coordinates its activities with other international programs such as the ESSP Global Carbon Project and the WCRP Climate and Cryosphere Project, and aims to develop an active network of scientists engaged in this type of research.

In the initial stage the existing Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) of the IPA/IUSS Cryosol Working Group will be further developed, by adding new data and information on carbon in permafrost, non-permafrost and peat soils. The NCSCD will aim to incorporate already existing data from poorly represented regions (e.g. Russia), and also from lake sediments and deep ice- and carbon-rich Quaternary deposits. CAPP related research and monitoring carried out by project participants is currently restricted to a limited number of locations. Within this project the participants will contribute to and initiate new research activities at up to 10-12 high latitude transects in the northern hemisphere, complemented by 2 transects in the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions, and additional altitudinal transects in high alpine environments. CAPP is therefore linked closely with IPY projects ANTPAS (33), TSP (50) and ACCO-NET (90).

The allocation of below-ground carbon in the landscape and quantity and quality among different permafrost settings will be investigated through intensive study sites along the transects. The organic matter will be analyzed using a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated geochemical and absolute dating techniques.

An important objective is to develop a carbon database that can be linked with remote sensing classifications at global to regional scales used in climate, biome and ecosystem models. Gained expert knowledge about soil carbon related processes will be used in process-based dynamic global vegetation models for a more reliable projection of the future terrestrial component of the global carbon balance and for model validation purposes. Results from CAPP will enable climate models to include one of the potentially most significant positive feedbacks in the global climate system. 

Protocols are developed for the carbon database, field sampling, physico-chemical analyses and upscaling exercises. CAPP activities will provide better understanding of total below-ground organic matter allocation and its susceptibility to decay. This will be used to evaluate the fate of this very significant carbon pool under global warming. High latitude terrestrial ecosystems are important reservoirs of soil organic matter. There is more carbon in these below-ground pools than in the living phytomass of all forests on Earth together. It is therefore important to communicate to the wider scientific community and general public the potential role of thawing permafrost carbon stocks in the Earth System.

initiative, a node of the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), has
developed a digital database of geo-referenced marine mammal, seabird and sea
turtle distribution and abundance data.  SEAMAP seeks to augment the public
understanding of the ecology of marine megavertebrates by: (1) facilitating
study of potential impacts on threatened species; (2) enhancing our ability to
test hypotheses about biogeographic and biodiversity models, and (3) supporting
modeling efforts to predict distributional changes in response to environmental

To enhance the research and educational applications of this database, SEAMAP
provides a broad array of products (e.g., tabular information, maps and
explicit survey meta-data) and services (e.g., web-based query, visualization

 The NEXRAD system (also known as Weather Surveillance Radar -
 1988 Doppler) is oneof NOAA's prime observation systems for
 acquiring information about meteorologicalconditions, and is
 also one of the key systems in NOAA's modernization and
 restructuring. Byusing Doppler radar technology, forecasters
 can observe the presence of precursor conditions ofsevere
 weather such as tornadoes, large hail and damaging thunderstorm
 winds. NEXRADallows for the detection of wind circulation
 patterns (e.g., mesocyclones) as precursors totornadic activity
 and provides data on the direction and speed of tornado cells
 once they form. NEXRAD also provides quantitative estimates of
 precipitation, which are important inforecasting flash floods,
 main stream river flooding and in water resource
 management. Thesevere weather and storm wind field detection
 capabilities offered by NEXRAD have contributedto a significant
 increase in the accuracy and timeliness of NWS warnings. The
 advantages ofNEXRAD ov!  er conventional radars can be broken
 down into five basic areas: improvedsensitivity, improved
 resolutions, wind velocity estimation, automated data
 collection in threedimensions, and capability for scientific
 processing of data. The benefits of this system will continue
 to be improved through scientific advances inthe use of weather
 radar data, and through improved processing and data
 disseminationcapabilities. A NEXRAD Product Improvement (NPI)
 Program has been established to plan andimplement these
 continued improvements. The primary goal of the NPI Program is
 to modify,augment and improve upon the existing capabilities of
 the NEXRAD system so it can support, ina cost-effective and
 timely manner, known operational requirements, as well as
 thoserequirements that can reasonably be anticipated.The NWS is
 currently implementing two major upgrades to the NEXRAD system:
 theOpen Systems Radar Product Generator (ORPG) and the Open
 Systems Radar Data Acquisition(ORDA). ORPG will !  be deployed
 in the calendar year 2000-2002 time frame. ORDA isschedule d
 for deployment in the 2002-2004 time frame. The deployment of
 ORPG will enablethe NWS to implement many additional scientific
 products and to support better communicationscapabilities,
 including dissemination of base data as required. ORDA
 deployment will enableimprovements in data quality, including
 mitigation of range folding, also known as 'purple haze.' Work
 is also underway to develop and test a dual polarization
 capability for NEXRAD. Dual polarization is a radar signal
 transmission, reception and processing scheme that
 providesinformation on the relative height and width of
 precipitation targets. Significant improvementsare anticipated
 in estimating the amount of rainfall and identifying
 precipitation types such asrain, snow and hail. If the
 development and testing validate the promise.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) field campaign is poised to help scientists identify how air pollution contributes to climate changes in the Arctic.

The campaign began April 2008 in Fairbanks, Alaska. Three NASA research aircraft -- the DC-8, P-3 and B-200 -- will serve as airborne laboratories for the next three weeks, carrying instruments to measure air pollution gases and aerosols and solar radiation. Of particular interest is the formation of the springtime "arctic haze," which is fueled by sunlight causing chemical reactions of pollutants accumulated over the winter from long-range transport from lower latitudes.

Surging glaciers are widely distributed in high mountain regions of the World and often are at the bottom of many natural catastrophic phenomenon (mudflows, outbursts of dammed lakes, ice avalanches etc). That's why the revealing of such glaciers and observation on their regime are of great scientific and practical importance.

At present as a result of field investigations, air photos and space images the regularities of fluctuations of many surging glaciers of the Pamirs (Oktyabrskiy, Gando, Bivachniy, Sugran and others) are investigated in detail. The Inventory of Surging Glaciers of the Pamirs was compiled. The experience of monitoring of these glaciers may be distributed at the glaciers of polar regions. That's why it is proposed to fulfil remote sensing investigations of surging glaciers of Alaska, Svalbard and Pamirs on the base of space images. In Alaska investigations of the regime of some surging glaciers (Muldrow, Variegated, Steele and others) were carried out. Usherbreen, Kongsvegen, Duckwitzbreen surging glaciers are the most investigated in the Svalbard.

The results of investigations of dynamically unstable glaciers in these regions will give an opportunity to define more precisely the elements of remote sensing monitoring of unstable glaciers in polar and continental regions, to clear up likeness and differences in their conditions.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This is a collaborative sedimentology, palynology, and paleomagnetic study of Permian and Lower Triassic strata in southern Victoria Land (SVL) and the Darwin Mountains (DM), Antarctica.  Results will help constrain the paleo-environmental, tectonic, palynostratigraphic, and paleogeographic histories of southern Pangea and provide a unique polar view of the world during an icehouse to greenhouse transition. 

Upper Paleozoic and Lower Mesozoic rocks in SVL and DM were deposited during Gondwanaland's drift across the south pole, and during a transition from Icehouse to Greenhouse conditions following the demise of late Paleozoic glaciation.  Based on present plate reconstructions, SVL and DM were located higher than 75  S from 320 to 210 Ma.  Therefore, SVL and DM strata may provide an unusual high latitude view of the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic world.  However, Permian and Triassic mean pole positions for Gondwanaland are not well constrained and have large errors associated with them. We will attempt to recover Permian and Triassic paleomagnetic signatures from petrified wood, silicified peat, and coal, all of which were cemented during early diagenesis (preliminary results indicate stable remanent magnetizations).

Despite a proposed high latitude position, SVL and DM sedimentary successions record a change from Lower Permian glacigenic deposits, to Permian fluvial coal measures, to Lower Triassic non-carbonaceous fluvial deposits, and finally to Middle and Upper Triassic fluvial coal measures.  Present climatic simulations suggest seasonal climatic extremes within Pangea's polar interior.  Discrepancies between the geological evidence and the climate simulations need to be resolved and may be magnified by incomplete understanding of the influence of paleotopography, large lakes, and river systems at the time of deposition, as well as by incomplete documentation of paleo-environmental conditions.

The assemblage and drift of Pangea resulted in heightened orogenic activity and associated development of numerous depositional basins.  One of the largest basins was the 10,000+ km long "Gondwanide foredeep" that extended across southern South America, South Africa, the Falkland Islands, Antarctica, and Australia.  Diachronous tectonism and an inversion tectonics are believed to have occurred along this margin.  Antarctica's centralized location between South Africa and Australia, make SVL and DM key areas for testing these hypotheses.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Science Summary:

This research project is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) . The research program was conducted for 13 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. This investigator used the Twin Otter logistics aircraft to conduct surveys of the surface temperature in the vicinity of the ship in order to determine the thin-ice thickness distribution. This research will be important for the determination of the effects of the flux of incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function of changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Ice surface temperature was measured with a narrow-beam radiometer and a video tape record of the surface was recorded during daylight flights. The surveys covered an area within 50 km of the ship. The sea ice temperature measurement program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present levels.

Logistics Summary:

For the Surface Heat Budget of the Oceans (SHEBA) Project, the Canadian Coast Guard Icebreaker Des Groseilliers was frozen into the Beaufort Sea pack ice 300 km north of Prudhoe Bay and left to drift from October 1997 to October 1998. The ship was used as a base of operations and floating scientific research station. During its year in the ice it followed a meandering path and ended up 400 miles north of its point of origin. During the SHEBA campaign, researchers conducted measurements in an approximately 100 square km area around the SHEBA site. Logistics were provided by ONR and U. Washington. This project utilized the Twin Otter logistics support aircraft to conduct surveys of the surface temperature from October 1997 through May 1998 . Nine survey flights were completed on six different campaigns.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=343

The Students on Ice-IPY Youth Expeditions (SOI-IPY) will be educational expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic for high school and university youth from around the world. Participating youth will travel on the expeditions together teams of leading scientists, expert and educators. The ice-strengthened ship-based expeditions will be unparalleled platforms for Polar Education. Since 1999, Students on Ice - the world leader in educational youth expeditions to the Polar Regions - has successfully operated 10 youth expeditions to both the Arctic and the Antarctic involving over 500 youth from 25 countries. Students on Ice is a member of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, and has been awarded the prestigious Michael J. Smith Award for Science Promotion in Canada. SOI-IPY will build on this success and experience together with international partners and related IPY initiatives. SOI-IPY will provide inspiring, life-changing experiences to youth; will inspire the next generation of Polar researchers and scientists; will raise awareness internationally about IPY and polar issues; develop Polar curriculum and resources; create media attention and a tv-documentary series; and overall will serve as a tremendous IPY legacy project.

SOI-IPY will organize and operate one Arctic expedition and one Antarctic expedition each year between 2007-2009, for a total of six educational polar expeditions between 2007-2009. The possibility of doing more than two expeditions per year will be determined by demand and funding. With sufficient interest and support, SOI-IPY will operate seperate high-school and university expedition programs.

Each expedition will have 75 participating youth, and 35 scientists, experts, educators, world leaders, journalists, etc. Participating youth will be between the ages of 14-25 yrs. The goal is to have a total of 450 participating youth from countries all around the world. Students will be selected through an application process available on the Students on Ice website www.studentsonice.com. Partnerships and contests around the world will also help to select the participating students. Corporate, government, foundation and private sector funding will assist youth with the costs to participate. In some cases, youth will also raise some or all of the funds required to participate. Through existing partnerships with the Arctic Council's Future of Children and Youth Initiative and other Aboriginal organizations, SOI-IPY will endeavor to have indigenous youth and staff from all of the circumpolar countries on each polar expedition.

Students will participate in a world-class, multi-disciplinary education program prior to and during each expedition. The academic program will weave together elements of experiential, expeditionary, and problem-based learning, and will focus on Experience, Understanding, Inspiration, Transformation, Action, and Change. Lectures, workshops, and hands-on activities will focus on subjects such as marine biology, glaciology, geology, environmental issues and sciences, history, culture, politics, flora and fauna, oceanography, sustainability, traditional knowledge, art, technology, and much more. Some of the scientific/education team will conduct hands-on science activities and research as part of their ongoing research projects. Youth forums, student-led action groups, and inter-generational mentoring are examples of other learning formats that will be incorporated. 

The educational benefits of SOI-IPY will be shared with millions of youth and the general public around the world via live video-conferencing, the SOI-IPY website, presentations, and conferences. Partnerships with schools and other educational organizations will bring the SOI-IPY directly to classrooms around the world. A team of international journalists and a film crew making a TV documentary series will help to give the youth voice a platform, spread IPY messages, and raise awareness about the environmental, historic, political and scientific importance of the planet's polar regions. 

SOI-IPY will partner with a number of respected organizations such as the Royal Canadian Geographic Society, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Explorer's Club, The Royal Geographic Society, the IPY Youth Steering Committee, the Youth Science Foundation, Science North, Canadas Department of Foreign Affairs, the Canadian Museum of Nature, the Canadian Space Agency, the International Baccalaureate Organization, and the International Polar Foundation.

and precipitation processes using a unique array of aircraft, balloon,
and land-based remote sensors. The first two CAMEX field studies were
conducted at Wallops Island, Virginia, during 1993 and 1995. The third
in the series of CAMEX field studies (CAMEX-3) was conducted in August
and September 1998, covering the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and
Atlantic Ocean. CAMEX-3 successfully studied Hurricanes Bonnie,
Danielle, Earl and Georges and collected data for research in tropical
cyclone development, tracking, intensification, and landfalling
impacts using NASA-funded aircraft and surface remote sensing
instrumentation.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Hindcasts for the Indian summer monsoons (ISMs) of 2002 and 2003 have been produced from an ensemble of numerical simulations performed with a global model by changing SST. Two sets of ensemble simulations have been produced without vegetation: (i) by prescribing the weekly observed SST from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting) analyses, and (ii) by adding weekly SST anomalies (SSTA) of April to the climatological SST during the simulation period from May to August. For each ensemble, 10 simulations have been realized with different initial conditions that are prepared from ECMWF data with five each from April and May analyses of both the years. The predicted June-July monsoon rainfall over the Indian region shows good agreement with the GPCP (observed) pentad rainfall distribution when 5 member ensemble is taken from May initial conditions. The All-India June-July simulated rainfall time series matches favourably with the observed time series in both the years for the five member ensemble from May initial condition but drifts away from observation with April initial conditions. This underscores the role of initial conditions in the seasonal forecasting. But the model has failed to capture the strong intra-seasonal oscillation in July 2002. Heating over equatorial Indian Ocean for June 2002 in a particular experiment using 29th May 12 GMT as initial conditions shows some intra-seasonal oscillation in July 2002 rainfall, as in observation. Further evaluation of the seasonal simulations from this model is done by calculating the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the GPCP rainfall over India. The first four EOFs explain more than 80% of the total variance of the observed rainfall. The time series of expansion coefficients (principal components), obtained by projecting on the observed EOFs, provide a better framework for inter-comparing model simulations and their evaluation with observed data. The main finding of this study is that the All-India rainfall from various experiments with prescribed SST is better predicted on seasonal scale as compares to prescribed SST anomalies. This is indicative of a possible useful seasonal forecasts from a GCM at least for the case when monsoon is going to be good. The model responses do not differ much for 2002 and 2003 since the evolution of SST during these years was very similar, hence July rainfall seems to be largely modulated by the other feedbacks on the overall circulation.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">THE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE-SALINITY PROFILE PROGRAM</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Program (GTSPP) is a cooperative international project. It seeks to develop and maintain a global ocean Temperature-Salinity resource with data that are both up-to-date and of the highest quality possible. Making global measurements of ocean temperature and salinity (T-S) quickly and easily accessible to users is the primary goal of the GTSPP. Both real-time data transmitted over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), and delayed-mode data received by the NODC are acquired and incorporated into a continuously managed database.  Countries contributing to the project are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States. Canada&amp;#039;s Marine Environmental Data Service (MEDS) leads the project, and has the operational responsibility to gather and process the real-time data. MEDS accumulates real-time data from several sources via the GTS. They check the data for several types of errors, and remove duplicate copies of the same observation before passing the data on to NODC. The quality control procedures used in GTSPP were developed by MEDS, who also coordinated the publication of those procedures through the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). The U.S. NODC performs four functions for the GTSPP: 
Maintains the global database of temperature and salinity data and provides online access to the data. 
Adds realtime data supplied by MEDS to the database. 
Processes delayed mode copies of data by performing the same data quality tests as MEDS, then adds data to the database. 
Prepares monthly data sets and transfers them by network to participants in the U.S., Australia and France, as well as to requestors. 
In addition to MEDS and NODC, three science centers participate in the project by independently evaluating the delayed-mode data sets for the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. Australia&amp;#039;s Commonwealth Scientific, Industrial and Research Organization (CSIRO), the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and NOAA&amp;#039;s Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) perform this function as Data Assembly Centers for the World Ocean Circulation Program, which GTSPP supports.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">IVARS</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">International Variability in the Ross Sea</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Ross Sea, a marginal Antarctic sea south of New Zealand, has been
studied since the days of the Scott/Amundsen expeditions. It is the
site of extensive penguin, bird and mammal colonies, and also the home
of two significant scientific bases, McMurdo Station (US) and Stazione
Baia de Terra Nova (Italy). Its oceanography is relatively well known,
including ... the physical oceanography and hydrography, nutrient
concentrations (nitrate and silicic acid), and phytoplankton biomass
and species composition. However, marked variations in these variables
occur spatially and temporally. Indeed, the variations with time are
the greatest factor in the Ross Sea habitat. For example, throughout
much of the winter the Ross Sea is ice covered, and no incident
radiation is available to drive photosynthesis. In contrast, during
the summer months the Ross Sea is ice-free, and large accumulations of
phytoplankton biomass occur.

In addition to these seasonal changes, variations among years occur in
all oceanographic variables, whether they be current velocities and
directions, ice concentration, winds, or phytoplankton
productivity. The causes and consequences of these interannual
variations, however, are poorly known. They likely have both local and
remote drivers; that is, ice concentrations are likely controlled by
the Antarctic circumpolar wave observed by White et al. (1999), as
well as by basin-wide changes induced by El Nino. Regardless of the
causes, the degree of variation among years in biological variables is
unknown, and this is what IVARS seeks to explore. Ultimately we hope
to understand not only the causes, but also the consequences to the
food web of the region.

How will we assess the interannual differences in biological
processes? We first will collect as much historical data from the
region from various cruises conducted in the past three decades and
generate a climatology or long-term mean of both nutrients (nitrate
and silicic acid) and chlorophyll concentrations. This will enable us
to compare results collected during our cruises to assess the degree
of variation from those observed earlier. The second approach is to
collect, from a pre-defined sampling grid, nutrient and phytoplankton
information using standard ship-board sampling procedures. Two cruises
per year are planned: one in mid- to late-December (the period of
maximum productivity and phytoplankton biomass), and one in
mid-February (the end of the growing season). A total of five field
seasons will be undertaken, with the first in 2001-2002 having been
already completed. By comparing the nitrate data from each cruise to
that of "pre-bloom" water (found prior to phytoplankton growth early
in the growing season), seasonal productivity can be calculated and
compared with that of previous years, hence quantifying the
interannual variations in seasonal productivity.

The third component of IVARS is the deployment of two moorings, each
with an elaborate suite of instruments designed to investigate the
proximate causes of the limitation of phytoplankton growth. The
locations of the moorings are placed where historically there are two
different phytoplankton assemblages. The first (Calinectes), located
north of Ross Island, is normally dominated by diatoms, whereas the
second (Xiphias) is dominated by the haptophyte Phaeocystis
antarctica. These phytoplankton types have extremely different roles
in the local food web and biogeochemical cycles. Each mooring will
have the following instruments on it: a fast repetition rate
fluorometer (FRRF), a nitrate analyzer, a silicic acid analyzer, a
whole water sampler, two additional fluorometers, a sediment trap,
thermistors, a CTD, and current meters. The aim of each mooring is to
provide continuous sampling of the surface layer properties to get a
closely spaced measurement of the variations within each growing
season. In addition, the FRRF gives an assessment of the degree of
limitation by inorganic nutrients. It has been shown that iron becomes
limiting in the austral summer (e.g., Olson et al., 2000), although
the extent and onset of this limitation is unknown. Using the FRRF
will give a sensitive measure of the degree of iron limitation through
time. The nitrate data will allow for continuous estimates of seasonal
production (and its short-term variations), and the silicic acid
measurements will allow for the estimation of diatom productivity (as
Phaeocystis antarctica does not use silica). Diatoms are often
considered to be more strongly iron limited than other species, but it
is uncertain if this is true in the Ross Sea. Furthermore, the ratio
of nitrate:silicate uptake is another indicator of iron stress in
diatoms, and will provide a separate estimate from the bulk community
measurements provided by the FRRF. Finally, the sediment trap will
allow estimates of the losses of organic material through the water
column, which can be compared to productivity and biomass estimates to
construct a one-dimensional budget of nitrogen (Smith and Asper,
2000).

Using this three-tiered approach, we hope to accurately assess the
variations in several important variables of the Ross Sea, and their
relationships to the food web of the region as well as to large-scale
forcing. Hopefully this record will also allow for an assessment of
subtle changes that might occur in future years in response to global
climate change. Such changes have already been observed in the
hydrographic conditions of the region (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2002), but
this would be the first attempt to relate biological responses of the
lower portion of the food web to large-scale changes in surface layer
properties that occur as a result of climate changes.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition 26</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

Project URL: http://naat.geobotany.org/index.shtml
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=139
One of the key goals of IPY will be to document the rapid and dramatic changes to terrestrial vegetation that are expected to occur across the circumpolar Arctic as a result of climate change. Changes in the biomass of terrestrial ecosystems will likely affect the permafrost, active layer, carbon reserves, trace-gas fluxes, hydrological systems, biodiversity, wildlife populations and the habitability of the Arctic. Changes in green biomass can be expected across the entire bioclimate gradient from treeline to the coldest parts of the Arctic. The Greening of the Arctic (GOA) initiative consists of a group of scientists who are part of four major components. 

The first component will examine in detail the 24-year record of greenness across the entire circumpolar Arctic as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using satellite imagery (AVHRR and MODIS). The study will examine historical trends in NDVI and document areas of major increases or decreases in the NDVI and link these trends to changes in sea-ice distribution, land-surface-temperatures, snow-cover, bioclimate subzones, vegetation type, glacial history, and other variables in a circumpolar GIS database that is part of the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM). Modeling studies will use the past trends in NDVI to predict future distribution of arctic vegetation using the BIOME4 model. Transient dynamics of the vegetation will be examined using the ArcVeg model. The project will focus along a North American Arctic Transect (NAAT) where extensive ground data are available. This component is already funded by NSF.

The second component will examine NDVI-ecosystem relationships along transects in North America and Eurasia at zonal sites in all 5 arctic bioclimate subzones. This portion of the study will take advantage of the existing NAAT that currently consists of 20 research sites in Alaska and Canada (Toolik Lake to Howe Island in Alaska, and Inuvik to Isachsen in Canada) that are part of several ongoing research projects. A similar transect through all five bioclimate subzones has been proposed for the Yamal Peninsula region in Russia, extending to Svalbard in the extreme High Arctic, the Eurasian Arctic Transect (EAT). The Russian part of the study is linked to the Circumpolar Arctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment (CARMA) project, and will examine the linkages between greening trends, the range and forage for the reindeers of the Nenets people, and the regional sea-ice conditions. The Russian component has been proposed to the NASA/USDA Land Cover Land-Use Change initiative. 

The third component will address the collection of ground biomass and site characterization along the NAAT and EAT transects. This will provide a legacy of the data and infrastructure along the full arctic climate gradient at representative sites in each arctic bioclimate subzone in western Canada and on the Yamal Peninsula-Svalbard transect. Standard protocols and field manual for biomass collection, and other site characterization will be developed. The biomass protocols will be developed in concert with researchers at other established sites such as existing CALM and ITEX sites and flagship observatories to expand the network of biomass collection sites. 

An outreach/education component of the project will develop a web-based Arctic Geobotanical Atlas (AGA) that will use a variety of tools to help students, educators, scientists, land managers, and the public to understand issues related to the greening of the Arctic. Users will be able to download and use online GIS data from the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map and maps at several sites along the GOA transects, in combination with other remote-sensing products. This component is already funded by an NSF grant. Educational application of the AGA in the classroom will be proposed at a later date. Linkage of the project to the University of the Arctic and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) will also occur in relationship to the human dimensions aspects of the project.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Integrated Forest Fire Management</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Background:

In 1982/83 one of the largest forest fires of this century raged for
several months through an estimated 5 million ha of Borneo's tropical
rainforests. The Indonesian province East Kalimantan was the area
worst hit by the burning. Since then, fire has been a recurring
feature on the island of Borneo, burning large areas in 1986, 1991,
1994 and 1997/98. In 1997/98, the fires again hit East Kalimantan very
hard, an estimated 5.2 mio ha of land was burned during this time. The
haze from these fires covered the South East Asian region for weeks,
causing health problems, disruption to shipping and aviation,
culminating in the closure of international airports. Economic losses
and ecological damage were enormous.

Wildfires in Indonesia are almost always human caused. A large
percentages of all wildfires result from escaped land-clearing fires,
or are a result of land use conflicts and land speculation. Fire is
the most common tool used by smallholders as well as for the agro- and
forest industries to prepare the land. Increasingly Indonesia's fire
and haze problem is being ascribed to large-scale forest conversion
and land clearing activities (pulp wood, rubber tree and oil palm
plantations). The fires can be ascribed as a symptom for the under
lying problems of land use planning as well as conflicts over land
use. Without solving these issues fire management will not be
successful. An extreme fire season usually occurs every 3-5 years,
when the climate in Indonesia becomes exceptionally dry due to the "El
Ni?o Southern Oscillation".

Project Description:

During Phase I (1994-1997) of IFFM, an appropriate level of fire
protection, training needs, suitable equipment, necessary fire
intelligence, institutional and structural support were
evaluated and determined in a pilot area. Cooperation with
relevant government agencies and timber concessionaires has
been ongoing. At the village level, socio-economic studies
have been carried out to elaborate a concept of
community-based fire management and to organise volunteer fire
response crews. Fire prevention material has been produced to
raise public awareness. Since the second phase, the scheme
determined in the Bukit Soeharto pilot area has been
replicated in other areas of East Kalimantan. Local fire
centres at all the 10 Cabang Dinas Kehutanan (District Forest
Offices) as well as National Parks are being established and
equipped, and personnel at all levels trained to prevent and
respond to wildfires. These local fire centres will form the
core of a fire management system for the!  province. The
provincial fire centre in Samarinda, located at DINAS
Kehutanan, will coordinate fire management activities in East
Kalimantan. It will collect information from the local
offices, provide fire intelligence (fire hot spot locations,
fire danger rating, radio communications) and coordinate the
sharing of equipment and fire-fighting personnel between fire
stations.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">PROTECTING TK</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Legal and Constitutional Frameworks for Protecting Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Northern Canada</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Indigenous peoples are seeking ways to preserve and protect their traditional knowledge, to incorporate it into both their own decision-making and broader decisions when it is relevant to assessing impacts on indigenous people. At the same time, the ability to exercise some control over indigenous knowledge and maintain its integrity is important. Indigenous people also recognize that their traditional knowledge (TK) may have an economic component and are anxious to share in the benefits that may flow from use of their TK. The fundamental question that this research project seeks to address is how the law responds to these interests of indigenous peoples. What are the alternate legal avenues capable of accepting indigenous claims based on TK and what are the implications both for indigenous people and society more broadly of incorporating TK into the law in these ways? How will recognition and incorporation of TK transform familiar legal landscapes?
This study in Northern Canada will provide policy makers and indigenous communities in Canada and other circumpolar nations with insight as to how to protect traditional ecological knowledge and traditional knowledge involving genetic resources. It will explore the legal response to increased participation of indigenous peoples in governance and the incorporation of TK in decision making. Traditional ecological knowledge has the potential to play a major role in developing resource management and environmental policy in Northern Canada. The issue of how to incorporate TK into governance frameworks in this area is particularly pressing given the current resource boom and the ecological pressures resulting from global climate change. The study will utilize first, a review of literature, land claims and self government agreements, agreements in principle and statutes and regulations to assess TK discourse, meanings, and governance and second a case study approach in collaboration with communities in the Nunavut, Northwest Territory and Yukon to answer the following questions.
Conceptual and Factual Inquiry:
1) Does TK exist as a single conceptual idea or is it just a way of referring to a set of (not necessarily similar) concerns?
2) If TK is a single idea, to what extent, if at all, does it differ from other forms of knowledge with which we are more familiar?
3) What is the connection between those holding TK and the TK? Is there a common connection or a variety of connections (religious, medicinal, economic, etc.)?
Legal Questions:
4) Does the nature of the connection in (3) give rise to rights in or to TK?
5) If so, what are the legal alternatives to providing those rights (property, liability rules, acknowledgement, inalienability, constitutional protection)? 6) Do the connections and the availability of alternative forms of protection fit within justifications given for property rights? If not, which of the alternatives is best justified?
Constitutional Questions:
One focus of our research is to explore whether TK in itself has any constitutional protection as an aboriginal right under s. 35 of the Canadian Constitution, or alternatively whether particular dimensions of TK may have some constitutional status as an integral aspect of broader rights. Protection of TK within the framework of rights to self-governance would provide indigenous people with the capacity to develop their own legal institutions relating to TK. We plan to explore the extent of rights and their interaction with other regulatory regimes, e.g., environmental and natural resource legislation. We also plan to explore the connection point between TK and indigenous rights under s. 35 and the duty of consultation and accommodation recently articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada.
While some of these questions arise in a Canadian Constitutional context, the interplay of rights discourse and TK has a broader significance in national and international law in circumpolar regions. We plan to explore all potential intersection points between TK and international, national, regional and private rules or norms with the aim of developing national and international guidelines for the protection of TK.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt (Dynamic) Deposition - VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortium (AARDDVARK) provides continuous long-range observations of the lower-ionosphere. The Konsortia sensors detect changes in ionisation levels from ~30-85 km altitude, with the goal of increasing the understanding of energy coupling between the Earth's atmosphere, Sun, and Space. We use the upper atmosphere as a gigantic energetic particle detector to observe and understand changing energy flows; this Science area impacts our knowledge of global change, communications, and navigation. The joint NZ-UK Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt (Dynamic) Deposition - VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortia (AARDDVARK) is a new extension of a well-establish experimental technique, allowing long-range probing of ionisation changes at comparatively low altitudes. Most other instruments which can probe the same altitudes are limited to essentially overhead measurements. At this stage AARDDVARK is essentially unique, as similar systems are only deployed at a regional level.

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">WINCE</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Winter Cloud Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Winter Cloud Experiment (WINCE) took place from January 23
to February 13, 1997. During WINCE, an instrumented NASA ER-2
high altitude research aircraft will be flown to learn more
about detecting clouds from space in winter conditions. WINCE
will provide important data with which scientists can improve
cloud detection for future satellite instruments such as the
MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This NASA
research instrument, scheduled for launch in mid-1998 as part of
Mission to Planet Earth, will assess earth climate trends of
which clouds are such an important component.

WINCE is jointly hosted by the University of Wisconsin's Space
Science Engineering Center and the 115 Fighter Wing, Wisconsin
Air National Guard, at Truax Field which will provide necessary
faciliites for supporting the NASA ER-2 research aircraft
operations. Madison-based Persoft is providing communications
equipment to facilitate remote data transfer to and from SSEC
computers, about 5 miles away from Truax Field. Persoft
specializes in PC-to-host software and wireless network
connectivity solutions.

UW scientists Steve Ackerman, William Smith and Paul Menzel will
head the scientific analysis of the data set, along with NASA
scientists Dorothy Hall, Jim Spinhirne and Jim Wang of the
Goddard Space Flight Center near Washington, DC. Their research
findings will be applied to cloud detection algorithms for the
MODIS and other future satellite instruments. "The high altitude
nature of the ER-2 (20 km or 65000 feet) is a key element of
WINCE. It allows our instruments to make cloud measurements much
as they would from a satellite platform. That makes it possible
for us to improve our cloud detection capability before the
satellite is ever launched," says Ackerman.

During WINCE, multispectral radiometric measurements of clouds
and the earth will be made by the MODIS Airborne Simulator
(MAS), the High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (HIS) and the
Microwave Imaging Radiometer (MIR) remote sensing instruments
on the ER-2. The measurements combine observations of the
microwave, infrared, and visible energy from clouds, atmosphere
and earth into a single measurement that can be used to analyze
the physical mechanisms important for weather prediction and
climate change. Signatures of clouds over snow-covered ground
are revealed using reflectance and temperature data derived
from these measurements. "In a visible image, both clouds and
snow-covered terrain are highly reflective, so they're hard to
tell apart," Paul Menzel explained. "In the infrared, cold
clouds and cold terrain emit roughly the same thermal
energy. Only with multispectral imaging can we hope to separate
clouds from snow and ice-covered terrain." Cloud height
measurements f!  rom the Cloud Lidar System (CLS) onboard the
ER-2 can verify the position and thickness of clouds in the
radiometric data. That data, when combined with the radiometric
measurements, allows UW scientists to examine the underlying
signature of the cloud itself.

Science Objectives:

1. Cloud detection/properties over snow/ice background
2. Snow detection
3. MAS/HIS absolute calibration comparison
4. SSEC ground-based instrumentation overflight
5. ADEOS underflights

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">MEDALPEX</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Mediterranean Alpine Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Mediterranean Alpine Experiment (MEDALPEX) formed an additional part of the
Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) subprogram on the airflow over and
around mountains.  MEDALPEX ran concurrently with the Garp Alpine Experiment
(ALPEX) - over the year from 1 September 1981 to 30 September 1982 with a
special observation period (SOP) from 15 february 1982 to 30 April 1982.  The
main aim of ALPEX was to study processes such as lee cyclogenesis and severe
local winds (for example the Mistral and the Bora), which have two frequency
peaks during the year, one in November and the other in April.  This was one of
the reasons for the SOP in April.
The Mediterranean is a deep enclosed sea where tides are small and motion is
essentially due to atmospheric forcing.  Oceanographic experiments with
simultaneous meterological data collection are necessary for a better
understanding of the dynamics of the Mediterranean and for setting up well
calibrated models.  The Mediterranean may also be regarded as a small scale
model of the ocean.  Thus studies on the dynamics of gyres, fronts, baroclinic
instabilities, eddies, turbulent dissipation and intermittancy, especially
during storm conditions, can contribute to the understanding of energy
transfers in the ocean and its boundaries.  The mesoscale eddies and meanders
which play an essential role in this circulation, forming the summer
thermocline and winter convection may also be studied.  All of the above rely
heavily on the spatial and temporal aspects of meterological processes.
The primary function of MEDALPEX was to study the response of the western part
of the Mediterranean to wind forcing.  The experiments which took place, often
as part of an individual country's oceanographic research program, were
designed with the intention of increasing understanding of the general problem
of meterological and oceanographic interactions.  Specific topics under
investigation included:
i) the interrelationship between the general circulation and mesoscale eddies;
ii) offshore dynamic response mechanisms under severe weather conditions.  The
behavior of the Mediterranean under severe weather conditions when
oceanographic ships cannot operate has, until now, yielded only limited
information.  MEDALPEX sought to collect data (especially during the SOP) to
give more complete information during periods of bad weather;
iii)storm surges and coastal piling up - for the Adriatic Sea, more detailed
verification of storm surges can be carried out with improved wind field data.
The Ligurian Sea has very small tides but sea level rises and coastal waves
during cyclogenesis damage the coastline.  With good wind field, wave and sea
level data, a model may be developed to simulate this.
MEDALPEX was a multinational program with participants from seven countries
(Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, U.K., U.S.S.R and Yugoslavia).  A wide range of
oceanographic data, including data from tide gauges, current meters, thermistor
chains, waverider buoys, CTD's and XBT's were collected.  Classical and synopt
meterological measurements were made and remote sensing techniques used.  The
data resulting from MEDALPEX were to be forwarded to the Responsible National
Oceanographic Data Center (RNODC) - in this case the World Data Center B
(Oceanography) in Moscow - with the exception of the sea level data.  The
Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) undertook to act as the Sea Level
Data Center for MEDALPEX; the data management and banking was carried out by the
Marine Information and Advisory Service (MIAS).

The objectives of the project are to establish a global inventory of land ice,
including surface topography, to measure the changes in extent of glaciers and,
where possible, their surface velocities. This project is designed to use
primarily data from the ASTER (Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and

to continue through the life of the ASTER mission. This work will also
establish a digital baseline inventory of ice extent for comparison with
inventories at later times.

accomplished by intercepting throughfall in approximately 2000
subcanopy troughs (0.3 x 5 m) suspended above the forest floor
on a "dry" treatment plot and transferring the throughfall
across a control plot for distribution onto a "wet" treatment
plot. Each plot is 80 x 80 m in size. The treatments result in a
33% decrease in precipitation reaching the forest floor on the
dry plot and a corresponding increase in precipitation on the
wet plot. Reductions in soil moisture on the dry plot are
expected to be equivalent to the driest growing seasons of the
1980's drought which resulted in reduced tree growth of some
species.

The Throughfall Displacement Experiment is supported by the
Program for Ecosystem Research (PER) in the DOE Office of
Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">BATSE was a high energy astrophysics experiment in orbit around Earth on NASA&amp;#039;s Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. The primary objective of BATSE was to study the phenomenon of gamma-ray bursts , although the detectors also recorded data from pulsars , terrestrial gamma-ray flashes , soft gamma repeaters, black holes, and other exotic astrophysical objects. 
BATSE responded to, or triggered on, sudden changes in count rates above background levels. It was also capable of detecting less impulsive sources by measuring their modulation using the Earth Occultation technique. View a typical one-day orbit of the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=400

ANTLER will provide a basis for research on the social significance of Rangifer (reindeer husbandry and caribou hunting). ANTLER is a research-network initiative with the aim to provide support, methodological integration, data management, and education and outreach facilities for participating projects. These projects share the same topic yet they may employ different methodologies. 

In addition to the existing scholarship on human-Rangifer relations, IPY 2007-2008 will foster new social-science case studies in many circumpolar regions where reindeer herding and/or caribou hunting take place. ANTLER seeks to unite these efforts, with the aim to assess the current social, socio-economic and cultural significance of reindeer herding and caribou hunting 'on the ground' and to provide reliable and realistic information for future management strategies. ANTLER participants will also compare and evaluate various methodologies in the field of Rangifer research and strategies for improved data management. ANTLER will contribute to a better understanding of an important human-animal relationship in the Arctic: on the one hand, through contributing knowledge concerning the social significance of Rangifer as it shapes human life in the Arctic; on the other hand, through examining the significance of human social, economic and political strategies as they affect Rangifer populations, distribution and its position in the Arctic ecosystem. ANTLER addresses reindeer herding and caribou hunting as important elements in Arctic and sub-Arctic environments and economies. The International Polar Year provides a timely and excellent framework for this international initiative, which will also serve as basis for enhanced multidisciplinary research on Rangifer. 

Within the wider field of research on human-Rangifer systems, ANTLER's main emphasis is on domesticated reindeer and the domain of knowledge produced by social sciences. It thus complements other projects (such as EALAT and CARMA) with their stronger emphasis on other domains of knowledge. 

Under the ANTLER umbrella there are two levels of integration. Firstly, there will be five or more key projects, so-called integrated projects, which serve as flagship activities with a research design tailored in accordance with the ANTLER agenda a priori. Secondly, there will be a number of associated projects, each of them designed in its own manner, which contribute selected data to ANTLER.

A network secretariat will organize three international workshops and provide communication and dissemination facilities. The initiators shall apply to the Finnish Academy and the ESRC (United Kingdom), which have a bilateral cooperation agreement, and the Norwegian Research Council for financial support for these central activities. 

This Cooperation Proposal is jointly submitted by three scientific institutions which have a pivotal position in Rangifer social-sicence research: the Arctic Centre of the University of Lapland (Finland), the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology (Germany) and the Scott Polar Research Institute (United Kingdom). The initiators have excellent connections to research institutions across the North, Arctic circumpolar communities and regional NGOs.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Dome C in Antarctica is potentially the best astronomical site in the world, with conditions close to space for some atmospheric windows. An extensive site testing program at the Concordia French-Italian station is underway. Comprehensive results of this program will be available during the year 2007. Small-scale astronomical experiments should also give their first results during the IPY. In 2007, astronomers will then be able to target precisely the best scientific and observational “niches” for astronomy at Dome C. The European network ARENA has started in January, 2006, and is devoted to this task. Among the observational niches, some are already clearly identified: submillimeter wavelengths, high angular resolution, as well as Wide field IR and optical observations, and continuous observations over days or weeks. The IPY offers a unique opportunity to discuss with national and international agencies the frame for a large astronomical infrastructure in Antarctica and to undertake its development.

The development of astronomy at Dome C, for which several French and international teams (Italy, Australia, China, Germany, United Kingdom…) have expressed their interest, has to be carried out in several steps. The next years (2006-2007) will be devoted to the completion of the site characterization in summer and winter. The development of small astronomical experiments will additionally provide an overview of the specific operational constraints that any observatory will face on this site.

The Greenland Ice Sheet Project II, initiated by the Arctic System
Science (ARCSS) at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), has
retrieved a deep-ice core from central Greenland. The
3053.44-meter-deep GISP2 core is yielding a high-resolution,
110,000-year-plus history of global change, including at least the

Arctic Base Camp (ABC)
Location: 72*42 North 77*57 West

Established in 1989, award-winning Arctic adventure company, Polar Sea Adventures (PSA) is based in Pond Inlet on the northern tip of Baffin Island in Canada's high Arctic. PSA offers a wide range of safe, high quality scheduled and custom-made adventure trips, expeditions and services. Each one professionally designed, in close consultation with clients, carefully promoting environmental awareness, exploration and respect for nature. One of the most northerly tour operators in the world - Polar Sea's trips, expeditions and projects are planned and delivered with the intention of being environmentally, socially and economically responsible. Polar Sea is sensitive to the effects of travel on the areas we visit. We live, and are based in the Arctic, therefore have a vital and vested interest in ensuring the areas we journey to and explore are respected and protected. Group sizes are kept small to avoid impacting the things that attract people to visit in the first place. We are actively dedicated to the protection of the Arctic and strive to play a role in encouraging and promoting the responsible and ethical development of this incredible, unique and important part of our planet.

The Arctic Base Camp (ABC) project involves PSA and a number of other related companies, individuals and organizations. The ABC will be the creation of a science based research facility that in addition will cater for a number of equally important activities and projects. In collaboration with outdoor equipment manufacturer Mountain Hard Wear, the ABC will consist of three Space Stations (kitchen, dining room and recreation room) twelve Satellite tents (for guests and staff accommodation) and two Stronghold (for workshops and laboratories) The Nunavut Territorial Government, Nunavut Tourism, the local hamlet council and local businesses have already expresses interest in the project

Uses for the ABC include: 
Science/research laboratory, training facility for young scientists and researchers, Inuit Elders &amp; Youth retreat, camp for schools, colleges and universities, training facility for young Inuit interested in a career in the sustainable tourism industry and as a defined destination for people from around the world interested in the Arctic environment.

The science and research part of the ABC would be set up similar to an Earthwatch program (earthwatch.org) Paying clients would be invited to join scientists and researchers in the field to help and assist with the work being done. The ABC season will start in early April and run until late September. Being located on the sea ice during the spring months, the camp will represent and illustrate low-impact and sustainable use of the Arctic environment. In late June the "land" on which it is located will cease to exist, therefore no trace of the camp ever being there will exist. The ABC will be seasonal yet prove to have year round benefits to all those involved.

The ABC will be created to be an on-going research and training facility. We believe that the long term benefits of the camp will be significant. Good science will be conducted and a sustainable project for the Inuit of the North Baffin region (and beyond) will be started and built upon.

The NASA-funded Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) project focuses on enhancing suspended sediment in satellite imagery related to tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico. Anlayzed data include color and infrared reflected bands from Landsat, MODIS, and SeaWiFS scenes related to tropical storms and hurricanes impacting the north-central Gulf from 2000 to 2009. Scenes include both pre- and post-storm data for each cyclone. Methodology for enhancing suspended sediment includes cluster busting, band ratio analysis, and ISODATA. Enhanced data shows suspended sediment carried out much farther into the Gulf than can be seen in normal true-color images. Increased area of sediment plumes from pre- to post- storm data is also visualized in the enhanced imagery and helps with comparison of pre- and post-storm runoff, sediment suspension, and transport patterns. ISODATA and band ratio analysis also returns spectral separation of suspended sediment plumes from Mobile Bay and the Mississippi River, a variation likely due to mineral composition differences.

Proposal URL:  http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=36

The overall goal of this initiative is to advance our knowledge of climate warming in the Arctic, by studying past climate change. We will focus mainly on the ocean circulation and climate of the NW Eurasian continental margin. The present climate in the Arctic shows signs of rapid change with decreasing sea ice cover and increasing temperature of the Atlantic Water. The implications of this warming are highly uncertain, as modelling experiments projecting temperatures for the next 100 years show a largescatter at high northern latitudes.

The project will include the following modules (M): M1 Rapid changes in the Atlantic Water inflow into the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, M2 Ice sheet/glacier response to warming, M3 Improving ocean temperature and sea-ice proxies; M4 Climate modelling.

M1: Periods in the past during which the climate was instable and reached warmer conditions than today: a) Marine isotope stages (MIS) 12/11; b) MIS 6/5; c) Younger Dryas/Holocene climate optimum, and d) last millennium. Sea Surface Temperature ( SST) will be quantified using a multidisciplinary approach, combining faunal/floral based transfer functions and geochemical tracers. For the Holocene and the last millennium climate will be investigated in marine sediments, lake sediments and ice cores from Svalbard and marine sediments from the SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland margin. Further, archaeological sites in Norway and Svalbard will be investigated to explore the relationship between climate and human settlement and activities. 

M2: Implications of climate warming for growth and decay of ice sheets and tide water glaciers, and its effect on ice stream dynamics in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard and SE Greenland margin.

M3: Reconstructions of SST below 5 OC based both on transfer functions and geochemical tracers are subject to large uncertainties. This is partly due to incomplete modern training sets at high latitudes. We aim to improve modern analogue data on planktonic and benthic foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, foraminiferal Ca/Mg-ratios and oxygen and carbon isotopes. From the same proxies we will also develop transfer functions for sea ice.

M4: An important motivation for attempting to simulate the climatic conditions of the past is that such experiments provide opportunities for evaluating how models respond to large changes in forcing.
Combined with high resolution acoustic data, cores will be sampled from high resolution sediment fans off northern and western Spitsbergen, the Spitsbergen fjords (in particular Kongsfjorden) and the Barents/Kara/Laptev Sea margin. Multi-core/box core surface samples &gt;70ON in the NE Atlantic will be sampled. The SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland component will rely on existing seafloor samples. The project will include exchange programs and training courses for PhD students and young researchers.
This expression of intent focus on research questions addressed by IGP-PAGES and CLIVAR.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SPREX (Spring Removal Experiment) took place in April 1985 in order to determine the processes affecting the transport and fate of freshwater input to the continental shelf off Georgia and South Carolina during the time of expected high runoff. It was hypothesized that this water is transported offshore in spring by a semi-permanent cyclonic eddy located at about 32/degree/N, 79/degree/W. The SPREX field program included a large array of moored current meters and other instruments, and three research vessels (R/V Cape Florida, R/V Cape Hatteras, and R/V Blue Fin) that conducted hydrographic mapping and biological and chemical sampling. Ship surveys (Cape Hatteras and Cape Florida) were designed to provide near synoptic coverage of a few specific events during SPREX. The purpose of the surveys was to determine the time variations in fresh water content and tracer concentrations over the shelf, the characteristics of shelf water/Gulf Stream water interaction, and biological responses to the events. The general cruise plan was for the Cape Florida to occupy CTD stations along cross-isobath transects out to the shelf break at three primary locations/endash/Savannah, Charleston, and Myrtle Beach. 4 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SciencePub aims to answer two critical questions in current Arctic climate research: What characterizes natural climate change in the Arctic, and how did early pioneer immigrants relate to climate change? By studying natural climate archives in terrestrial and marine sediments from Svalbard, N Norway, NW Russia and adjoining seas we will advance the knowledge on processes operating during non-glacial and glacial periods. We will use this to reconstruct past changes in the climate, and the physical environment during the last interglacial-glacial cycle. This will be used to gain new insights into human immigration and adaptation strategies at the end of the last glaciation. Our cross-institutional and multidisciplinary team will use both new and well-established methods to extract quantitative and qualitative paleoclimate data to explore the interplay between the Arctic land, ocean, ice sheets and early human settlement. We will investigate modern and past land-ocean environments, including: 1) variability in the influx of warm Atlantic Water and its implications for growth and decay of ice sheets and ice streams; 2) fresh water flux to the ocean through outbursts of ice-dammed lakes and re-routing of NW Russian rivers; 3) early human responses to rapid changes in sea-level and temperatures at the end of the last glaciation, and 4) models of the human pioneer adaptations and settlement.

SciencePub will strive to leave a lasting legacy of increased public awareness of the natural environmental system of the Arctic through outreach activities. These will include networking information officers from all partner institutions, training of science journalists, and by developing visualizations and mobile exhibitions. This project will strengthen Arctic competence and expertise by training young PhD- students and post docs, networking Norwegian institutions, build broader international networks, and strengthen cooperation with Russian scientists and institutions.

The Seasonal Ice Zone Experiment (SIZEX) began on January 13, 1989,
when the POLARBJORN sailed from Tromso en route to operations in Fram
Strait. The first cruise lasted from February 9 until March 5, 1989,
and the second one from March 8 until April 2, 1989. Biophysical
oceanographic operations commenced April 4 and concluded May 17,
1989. The first SIZEX cruise concentrated on conditions in the
vicinity of Bjornoya, south of Svalbard; all subsequent cruises were
located in the Fram Strait region west of Svalbard.

The HAAKON MOSBY's (University of Bergen, Norway) participation in the
SIZEX phase began on February 25, 1989, when the ship left Tromso,
Norway, bound for regions in the Barents Sea. From February 26 to
March 7, 1989, the ship operated in the general area between the
Svalbard and the northern coast of Norway. On March 7, the HAAKON
MOSBY headed northwest toward regions in the Fram Strait west and
southwest of Svalbard, where the ship cruised seaward of the pack ice
edge from March 11 to March 19, 1989. The HAAKON MOSBY then headed
southeast into the Barents Sea, finally returning to port on March 23,
1989.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Open Geospatial Consortium/Web Feature Service is a specification developed
by the Open Geospatial Consortium that describes Web Feature Server (WFS)
operations. The WFS operations support INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, QUERY and
DISCOVERY of geographic features using HTTP as the distributed computing
platform.

This document adopts the same concept of a geographic feature as described in
the OGC Abstract Specification and interpreted in the Geographic Markup
Language (GML) Implementation Specification [2]. That is to say that the state
of a geographic feature is described by a set of properties where each property
can be thought of as a {name, type, value} tuple. The name, number, and type of
each feature property is determined by its type definition. Geographic features
are those that may have at least one property that is geometry-valued. This, of
course, implies that features can be defined with no geometric properties at
all. The geometries of geographic features are restricted to what OGC calls
simple geometries. A simple geometry is one for which coordinates are defined
in two dimensions and the delineation of a curve is subject to linear
interpolation. The traditional 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometries defined in a
2-dimensional spatial reference system are represented by points, line strings
and polygons. In addition, the OGC geometry model allows for geometries that
are collections of other geometries - either homogeneous multi-point,
multi-line string, and multi-polygon collections or heterogeneous geometry
collections. Finally, GML allows features that have complex or aggregate
non-geometric properties.

The architecture includes:

Client Application Any program or process that communicates with a web server
using HTTP. The most typical example is a web browser but other types of
programs can exist as well.  For example, one can imagine a data loader or
geodata editor that communicates with an HTTP server.

HTTP Server
Any program that services HTTP requests. For example, the Apache program is an
HTTP server.

Web Feature Server
A program or module that implements support for transaction and/or query
operations on web accessible features

OGC Feature Datastore
A software system for persistently storing and managing the spatial and
non-spatial properties of geographic features. The management system can be a
SQL relational database, flat files, an ARCINFO database, an XML based
datastore, etc...

WAISCORES researchers have proposed analysis of two ice cores -- one from Siple Dome, in the Siple Coast region, and one from upslope of Byrd Station in West Antarctica. Access to two cores, one from near the coast and one from an inland site, should allow researchers to distinguish local from regional influences on the climate records recovered from the cores. Drilling for the Siple Dome core began in November 1996 and finished in January 1999. The core site is located between ice streams C and D at approximately 81° 40&amp;#039; S and 148° 49&amp;#039; W.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=50

The International Permafrost Association's (IPA) main contribution to IPY will be the development of a spatially distributed set of observations on past and present status of permafrost temperatures and active layer thicknesses. Emphasis is on permafrost temperatures since there is currently no global database that defines the thermal state of permafrost (TSP) for a specific time period (snapshot). The TSP data set will serve as a baseline for the assessment of the rate of change of permafrost temperatures and permafrost distribution, to validate climate model scenarios, and to support process research in order to improve our understanding of permafrost dynamics. 

TSP measurements, a field component of the WMO/GCOS Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P), address questions related to climate warming and the attendant environmental and societal issues in the cold regions of Planet Earth (both polar regions and mid-and lower-latitude mountains and plateaus). These observations will serve as a lead element for the development of an International Network of Permafrost Observatories (INPO). Related activities include coastal erosion, belowground carbon in permafrost regions, regional mapping, data management and education. 

The Permafrost Observatory Project has as its major objectives to:
-Obtain a standardised set of permafrost temperature profiles throughout the permafrost regions of Planet Earth (snapshot); 
-Produce retrospective and contemporary global data sets of permafrost temperatures, active layer thicknesses and temperatures, and coastal erosion rates; 
-Increase the number of GTN-P boreholes, active layer, and coastal erosion sites; 
-Develop new estimates of below-ground carbon in permafrost regions;
-Develop and promote educational and other training programs;
-Develop additional approaches for reanalysis of past, present and future permafrost and active layer temperatures;
-Develop research activities at site-specific and regional scales including the formalization of a periglacial monitoring network and regional permafrost mapping;
-Utilise standard protocols and conform to IPY data management policy;
-Report ongoing and new results at international conferences in summer 2008.

The Permafrost Observatory Project (IPY Permafrost Cluster) will consists of two major permafrost subcomponents or subclusters that provides the central focus and responds to IPY Themes 1 (Status/Baseline), 2 (Change), and 5 (Vantage point); and two subcomponents consisting of Bipolar outreach and permafrost-related activities:

1. International Network of Permafrost Observatories (INPO) builds on several existing and developing IPA programmes and projects: GTN-P (both TSP-125 and Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM-439) components), Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE-175); and Arctic Coastal Dynamics (ACD), links to other closely related projects including ACCO-Net (182), CoCRA (391), Carbon Pools in Permafrost Regions (CAPP) as the IPA contribution to Permafrost and Carbon Emissions (PEACE: 882), the developing periglacial network, and several mapping projects (Nordic region, Central Asia). 

2. Antarctic Permafrost, Permafrost and Soils (ANTPAS-627) project is developed with the SCAR Expert Group on Permafrost and Periglacial Environments, and including ANTPAGE (357). ANTPAS project is submitted separately to the JC in coordination with SCAR and appropriate national Antarctic programmes.
 
3. Bipolar outreach subcomponent including the existing IPA data, education and communication activities and developing new international university courses and training on permafrost with links to many other complementary IPY projects.

4. Permafrost-related subcomponent includes EoIs that have permafrost-related activities and are directly related to 1-3.

The main Field Campaign is planned for the 12-18 month period during 2007-08, but starting in 2006 with the inspection of potential remote boreholes. The updated GTN-P catalogue of boreholes consists of more than 600 candidate boreholes throughout the permafrost regions (the majority of potential sites are in Russia), 125 sites in the CALM network, and some 25 coastal (ACD) key sites. A Project Steering Committee is under development. Data will be incorporated into the GTN-P and archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), Boulder, Colorado. Education and training activities are to be coordinated and developed through the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). IPA/IPY activities will be incorporated into the IUGS International Year of Planet Earth. During summer 2008 our results will be presented at the Ninth International Conference on Permafrost in Fairbanks, Alaska, and at the 33rd International Geological Congress in Oslo.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical
 and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper
 atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and
 glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric
 observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research
 Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as
 described in the previous chapter.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This Activity involves science and social science research that has been initiated as a result of the recent melting of glaciers and alpine ice patches. Melting of these scientific “deep freezes”, is providing unanticipated data sources that are giving us insight into past northern societies, flora/fauna, environments, and their changes through time. The field work is already happening as various independent projects in different northern North American jurisdictions (both Canada and United States), operating under northern leadership and direction. These projects will continue to operate in a similar manner if endorsed as an official IPY Activity. Thus the following Activity Summary refers to the work in general, rather than in project-specific terms.
In 1997/98, ancient organic artifacts and biological remains, particularly large quantities of caribou dung, were first found melting out of an alpine ice patch in southern Yukon, Canada (Kuyzk, et al., 1999, Arctic 52-2:214-219). The following year, 1999, the remains of Kwaday Dan Ts’inchi meaning “Long Ago Person Found” in Southern Tutchone (Athapaskan) were found melting out of a glacier in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park in adjacent northwestern British Columbia, Canada (Beattie et al.,, 2000, Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24:129-147).
In 1999, more artifacts and biological remains were found at other melting south Yukon ice patches. Within a few summer field seasons of research, significant specimens and samples (paleo-biological, or paleobiological and archaeological) were identified and/or collected from more than 70 mountain-top ice patches in the latter jurisdiction. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the frozen organic remains being recovered from the Yukon ice patch sites spanned the entire Holocene period (Farnell et al., 2004, Arctic 57-3:247-259. Hare et al., 2004, Arctic 57-3:260-272).
The banking and curation of the samples/specimens recovered as a result of the Yukon ice patch work has been coordinated by the Yukon Government (Renewable Resources, and Heritage-Archaeology) with local study and analysis of materials, as well as research and identification work by collaborating scientists from other institutions. Studies related to the ancient artifacts have included feather identification and analysis by staff of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington (Dove, et al., 2005, Arctic 58-1:38-43), and paint analysis by staff of the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa (Helwig et al., unpublished). Studies related to the biological specimens have been wide-ranging, including: research on species, particularly caribou, genetic history through mtDNA research; caribou dietary analysis; industrial contaminants analysis; parasite history; pollen and vegetation history; ice patch shrinkage over time; etc. (Farnell et al., ibid.).
The Kwaday Dan Ts’inchi project is also locally administered, with the concerned indigenous government, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, jointly managing the project with the province. The provincial museum (Royal British Columbia Museum), the Provincial Parks’ department, as well as scientists based in Canada, Germany, and Scotland are working with the community on the study and interpretation of this find, and the materials recovered there-from, with results now being published (e.g., Monsalve et al., 2002, American Journal of Physical Anthropology 119-3:288-291; Dickson et al., 2004, Holocene 14-4:481-486; Mudie et al., 2005, Canadian Journal of Botany 83:111-123; Richards et al., in press, American Antiquity). Both the discovery and the manner in which this unique find is being managed continue to receive international attention; the project is often pointed out as an example of how scientists and First Nations can work together on even the most sensitive of subject areas, human remains.
Colleagues began fieldwork in adjacent Alaska in 2001, continuing in 2003, attempting to find glacier or ice patch archaeological sites in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. This work involved the development of a predictive model for identifying locations that should be targeted in the search for archaeological and/or biological specimens in these frozen landscapes (Dixon et al., 2005, American Antiquity 70-1:129-143). In 2003, state archaeologists successfully identified ice patch archaeological sites in the Tangle Lakes (Denali Highway) area of the state (Vanderhoek et al., in press, Alaska Journal of Anthropology). Fieldwork has continued in this location and elsewhere in the state, with ongoing analysis of the recovered materials.
The identification of ice patch sites yielding biological and cultural specimens and samples began in the Mackenzie Mountains region of Northwest Territories, Canada in 2005, with positive results (Andrews, 2005 communication to Activity leader). Plans are underway to search for ice patch sites in the Atlin area of northern British Columbia, Canada in 2006 (French, 2005 communication to Activity leader). Archaeological survey to search for specimens melting out of glaciers in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, U.S. is also to be initiated in 2006 (Howell, 2005 communication to Activity leader).
Fieldwork to find and recover the specimens and samples melting out of the glaciers and ice patches in northwestern North America, as well as to study the melting phenomena themselves, takes place during the height of the summer melt season each August. The fieldwork is generally conducted as day trips or short excursions, relying on helicopters for logistic support; over-view (fixed wing) flights have also been found to be useful.
The materials being recovered from these frozen contexts include ancient artifacts, biological materials such as small bird and animal remains, dung from different species but predominantly caribou in the case of the ice patch sites, plant macro and micro remains, and ice block samples. The specimens collected are often fragile and following field documentation, in many cases must be quickly transferred to refrigerated storage to prevent deterioration. After recovery, the specimens and samples are curated in local government facilities whenever possible; professional Conservators are stabilizing the more fragile and significant artifact pieces. Laboratory work to study both the biological and archaeological specimens and samples recovered during these projects is being undertaking by government researchers based in the north, where-ever possible, working in collaboration with scientists/specialists at southern institutions.
The local communities are involved, as well, in the study and interpretation of the recovered materials. For example, funds are being sought to document traditional indigenous knowledge related to the unique archaeological finds being collected by the Yukon Ice Patch project. Research to document the traditional aboriginal use of these landscapes is also part of the some of the projects. Museum displays on some of the finds are already in place, e.g., Kwaday Dan Ts’inchi at the Royal British Columbia Museum, and more are in the works.

In spite of its remoteness and isolation, Antarctica is inextricably linked to global processes and exposed to the impact of human activities in the rest of the world. Climate changes are expected to produce faster and greater changes in high-latitude regions, because they are likely to be amplified by alterations in albedo, atmospheric precipitation and permafrost. These changes will affect Antarctic life forms, from the individual and population scale to whole communities. A better knowledge of interactions among climate, geomorphological, geopedological and hydrological features, biological and genetic diversity, and functioning of Antarctic ecosystems across broad scale gradients, is necessary to point out weak points of these interactions and to achieve a better understanding of climate-induced changes in ecosystems at lower latitudes, where responses of biotic communities to external forcing are buffered by more complex interactions and feedback processes. Through the involvement of a selected number of Italian and Czech research groups on Antarctic biology and ecology, and an ad-hoc improvement of scientific and logistic integration and exchanges between Italy and other (SCAR) countries, our intent is to study the effects of climatic and environmental changes, as well as the impact of anthropogenic contaminants on organisms and ecosystems of northern Victoria Land, James Ross Island (Antarctic Peninsula), and Patagonia. As Antarctica receives pollutants from local sources (e.g., research stations, tourism) and acts as a cold trap for atmospheric mercury and persistent organic pollutants from other continents and secondary local arising organic photo-pollutants, our aim is to establish possible sources, deposition patterns, and biological effects of persistent pollutants, through the collection and analysis of widely distributed species of uni- and pluricellular organisms. Key species of organisms will also be collected across the latitudinal transect to study their origin, evolutionary responses to different climatic and environmental conditions, genetic links and interactions with relatives in the rest of the world. Through a functional genomic approach, the evolution of structural modifications of genes responsible for adaptations to cold, dry and salty environments, will be investigated to identify biochemical markers, which can provide means to study reactions to climate and environmental changes. In selected dominating moss and lichen species, the rate of photosynthesis and respiration will be measured and the acclimation/adaptation to long-term and short-term action of stress factors such as radiation, dehydration and low temperature will be studied. We propose internationally coordinated expeditions in northern Victoria Land, James Ross Island and Patagonia, with exchange of researchers and logistic support among Italian, Czech, and other national polar operators (austral summer 2007/08) to study: (1) soil formation processes and soil organic matter, (2) long-range transport and deposition of persistent contaminants, (3) Antarctic ecosystem biodiversity and functioning (4) the phylogeny and genetic variability of bacterial, protozoan, cryptogamic, and invertebrate populations.

Project URL: http://nsidc.org/eloka/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=187

ELOKA (the Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic) is envisioned as a data management service and circumpolar network for IPY 2007-2008 and beyond; its main purpose is to support and connect local and traditional knowledge projects and community-based research and monitoring programs around the North. ELOKA will be a central data portal, data management service, networking service, and resource center related to the knowledge and observations of Arctic residents. In setting up these pioneer goals, ELOKA will make a major contribution to one of the IPY 2007-2008 missions, namely, to bridge scientific studies of polar environments with the observations and ecological knowledge of polar residents. ELOKA will be an important tool in facilitating contributions from, and access by, Arctic communities to IPY research and future Arctic research.

One of the challenges of local and traditional knowledge (LTK) research and community-based monitoring to date has been effective and appropriate means of recording, storing, and managing data and information. It has been a challenge to find effective means of making community-based data and information available to Arctic residents and researchers, as well as other interested groups such as teachers, students and decision makers. ELOKA seeks to fill this gap. ELOKA will have a strong emphasis on serving Arctic community-based organizations and research through support for local and traditional knowledge projects and community-based monitoring projects by developing new management systems for data in non-numerical formats such as video, audio, maps, artwork, and photographs, and context-specific data such as interview transcripts and recorded oral histories. In ELOKA, data management does not mean data control. ELOKA will be a collaboratively designed tool that various organizations, communities, and projects can use under their own terms to help them store, search and share information. ELOKA will help LTK and community-based projects store and manage their data if that is their need, or simply provide links to those projects that are managing their own information. At the same time, ELOKA will help to negotiate and establish protocols so information is comparable across projects and regions (e.g. work to develop common approaches to metadata). ELOKA will take up the challenge to design systems of data stewardship that will respect the unique sensitivities and protections needed in community-based projects, while still allowing for broad searches for information. 

The World Data Center for Glaciology (WDC) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in the U.S. propose to coordinate ELOKA. Drawing from and building upon existing data management resources and experienced staff that already handle diverse sources and forms of information, WDC/NSIDC will provide the technical backbone needed for ELOKA. With the technical component available to build on, ELOKA then proposes to collaborate with projects and organizations such as the Arctic Residents Network (ARN), Arctic Community-Based Environmental Monitoring Observation and Information Stations, and CAFF's (Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna) CBMP (Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program), to work on issues of best practices and cross-community collaboration. ELOKA will work closely with the proposed IPY Data and Information Service (DIS) and with indigenous organizations at all levels, such as RAIPON (Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North) and ICC-Greenland (Inuit Circumpolar Conference-Greenland). ELOKA would be part of broader consortiums for Arctic observation and monitoring by providing an LTK focus for such as programs as COMAAR (Consortium for Coordination of Observation and Monitoring of the Arctic for Assessment and Research), the above-mentioned CBMP, and CEON (Circumarctic Environmental Observatories Network). We have partnered with a number of LTK and community-based projects (see 4.2) to initiate the development of ELOKA and will continue to build partnerships with community-based programs, organizations and networks during IPY and beyond. Feedback from the individual projects and organizations contributing and using information at ELOKA will be a key part to the development process. Many community-based projects not submitting proposals to IPY are also interested in ELOKA some of these are listed in 4.2. We expect our partner list to grow in coming months.

The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, by making nearly polar orbits roughly 14.1 times daily. Since the number of orbits per day is not an integer the sub orbital tracks do not repeat on a daily basis, although the local solar time of each satellite's passage is essentially unchanged for any latitude. Currently in orbit we have a morning and afternoon satellite, which provide global coverage four times daily. The POES system includes the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS).

Because of the polar orbiting nature of the POES series satellites, these satellites are able to collect global data on a daily basis for a variety of land, ocean, and atmospheric applications. Data from the POES series supports a broad range of environmental monitoring applications including weather analysis and forecasting, climate research and prediction, global sea surface temperature measurements, atmospheric soundings of temperature and humidity, ocean dynamics research, volcanic eruption monitoring, forest fire detection, global vegetation analysis, search and rescue, and many other applications.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=162


Presently there are over 4 million wild and 1.8 million domestic reindeer and caribou inhabiting the earth's arctic regions. This keystone species has been an economic and cultural mainstay of nearly every indigenous group in the Arctic. Recent profound changes have been occurring in the North with the potential to jeopardize the relationship forged over countless generations between Rangifer, the land and the people. 

In late 2004 a concerned circumpolar group of social scientists, biologists, ecologists, abiotic specialists, aboriginal leaders, and resource managers met in Vancouver, Canada to launch an organization to track and assess the impacts of the changes that are occurring. This group, the CARMA Network (CircumArctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment network www.taiga.net/CARMA ) defined its mission:

To monitor and assess the impacts of global change on the human/Rangifer system across the Arctic through cooperation, both geographically and across disciplines. 

At present, knowledge of many of the Arctic's significant Rangifer populations is fragmented and the relationship among the peoples dependent upon these populations is largely undocumented. Therefore, the CARMA Network proposes an extensive two-year coordinated program through IPY that will 
1) provide a solid baseline of information on representative Rangifer populations and the human communities dependent upon them
2) establish an on-going monitoring and assessment network of these systems 

To meet these objectives, the following operating principles are proposed: 
-Keep it simple, relevant to the needs of Arctic residents; keep it transparent
-Conduct monitoring and assessment using an interdisciplinary approach
-Include and integrate local/traditional knowledge, industry research, field-based biological studies, and remote sensing research
Focus initially on wild Rangifer populations and those human communities that use the Rangifer resource
-Build on existing monitoring and assessment programs
-Serve as a central depository for historical and current information on indicators 
-Develop and standardized protocols for collecting, documenting, and assembling indicators 
-Provide annual analysis on indicators by region and value-added indicators that all regions can share 
-Use a comparative approach to address research questions and advance common understanding of the Arctic System
-Serve as a resource for policy makers facing regional decisions related to Human-Rangifer Systems 

Questions to be addressed include (but are not limited to): 

-What are the most predictive indicators of change in the resilience of Human-Rangifer Systems? 
-How will the combined heterogeneity of regional climate forces and ecological conditions affect availability and use of wild Rangifer?
-How do we best measure the cumulative effect of landscape-level human activity, climate change, and management policies on the Human-Rangifer Systems? 
-How may disease and parasites that are affected by climate change potentially affect the health of caribou?
-What are the key social-ecological thresholds of critical change in these systems?
-How can these systems be managed to enhance sustainability and adaptive capacity?

We consider such a project as starting the clock across the North, where information gathering is coordinated and comparable, where protocols are standardized, tested and utilized. At the completion of the IPY period, CARMA will produce a comprehensive comparative analysis of Circumarctic Rangifer populations, which will be the tangible legacy upon which the CARMA Network can proceed into the 21st Century.

    The aim of the JOULE project JOU2-CT93-0390, WERATLAS, is the
assessment of the wave energy resource available along the European
coasts. To avoid the strong spatial variability associated to coastal
topography and geometry, the information which is to be provided as a
PC Atlas will cover offshore deep water conditions. Coastal conditions
at a site of interest could be estimated from the WERATLAS data using
a suitable coastal wave model.

    Ideally, long term statistics should be based on measured
data. Two type of measurements are presently available:

1) long time series at fixed positions, mostly obtained with buoys,

2) extensive measurements in space, but desultory in time, obtained with
satellite altimeters. While their overall amount is rapidly growing with time,
those are still far from the quantity and spatial coverage required for a
generalised statistics.

  The alternative source is the output of sophisticated wave models, that
provide a detailed description of the wave conditions over the whole basin of
interest. The limit to the accuracy of their results is mostly determined by
the accuracy of the input wind. While the present meteorological models are
capable of remarkable accuracy in the description of the surface wind fields,
particularly in the open oceans, their quality deteriorates when we move back
in time - key are 1987 and 1991, when, following the evolution of computer
power, substantial model improvements took place.

   The two main European sources of information about wind and waves are the
European Centre for Medium-Range  Weather Forecast (ECMWF, Reading, UK) and
the UK Meteorological products from the two centres revealed that ECMWF data
was the more accurate data set. We have therefore based our analysis on this
source.

   ECMWF runs daily two wave models, one globally and one for the
Mediterranean Sea, since July 1992. To extend the analysis period, the wave
model (the third generation WAM model) was run for the Atlantic ocean since
1987 using the locally archived wind fields. This has not been possible for the
Mediterranean Sea, because of the low quality of the wind fields in this area
before the latest improvement.

   The wave model data are being validated, and possibly calibrated, using
available buoy and satellite data. Note that the calibration is possible only
under certain conditions (spatial uniformity being the stringent one) and after
a careful screening of the data with respect to the height, period and
direction.

    Where the wave model results are less reliable, we use only the
available measured data. This is the case for the Norwegian Sea (near the
northern limit of the model) and the North Sea (due to the coarse resolution
used in the Atlantic wave model).

    We summarise below the main characteristics and the locations of the
available data.

Our objective is to improve understanding of the controls on carbon (C), water and energy exchange between arctic terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. We propose a linked programme of plant and soil process studies, isotope analyses, flux measurements, micro-meteorology, process modelling, and aircraft and satellite observations to improve predictions of the response of the arctic terrestrial biosphere to global change. 
Climate warming is resulting from disruption of the global C cycle. The Arctic is already warming significantly, and warming is expected to be fastest and greatest at high latitudes, 4-7ºC over the next century. However, complex linkages between climate, C cycle, energy balance, and hydrology mean that the details of such changes and the response of arctic ecosystems remain poorly understood. The Arctic governs some critical feedbacks in global change: (i) the release by warming of considerable but poorly quantified C stores from high latitude soils (20-60% of the global soil C pool, (Hobbie et al., 2000)) could accelerate the build-up of atmospheric CO2, (ii) a shift in albedo from vegetation changes and altered snow dynamics may affect the global energy balance, (iii) alterations in river discharge into the Arctic Ocean, due to changes in arctic hydrology, may affect the thermohaline circulation (Peterson et al., 2002). Our proposed research will resolve critical unknowns related to these potential feedbacks in the arctic C, energy and water cycles. To improve our understanding of the C, water and energy cycles, we will:
· quantify the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM), particularly of contrasting age;
· quantify the differences in C uptake, respiration and allocation among key arctic vegetation types and their responses to drivers: snow, soil temperature (and freezing) and soil moisture);
· test whether regional estimates of the C cycle derived from atmospheric sampling by aircraft are consistent with upscaled measurements from the land surface;
· determine regional budgets of net CH4 emissions and their repose to the hydrological drivers;
· generate improved estimates of the total C stocks of arctic systems in soils and vegetation, with a detailed estimate of errors;
· investigate the strength of coupling between land-atmosphere energy exchanges and local snow cover and soil moisture;
· test the accuracy of snow melt, soil moisture and thaw predictions; and determine how to better represent sub-grid scale hydrological processes in regional and global climate models;
· determine how the interactions of topography with seasonal changes in hydrology govern the strength of C sources and sinks over the arctic landscape.
Our approach is based on linking multi-scale measurements with models representing our best current understanding. We will determine C, water and energy fluxes at a range of scales using small chambers, eddy flux towers, and aircraft. We will monitor C allocation and turnover in vegetation and soils using direct sampling, but also isotopic analyses and labelling experiments. We will determine landscape patterns of vegetation C, soil C and moisture, and snow-cover with a mix of field surveys, aircraft and satellite imagery. We will use a mix of simple empirical models, ecophysiological models, C turnover models and a land surface scheme from a climate model. Our multi-scale measurements, extensive surveys and process investigations will help to determine the errors in current model characterisations of the behaviour and state of the Arctic, which are reliant on relatively coarse resolution data on soils and vegetation, and simple descriptions of key processes. Close integration of models with data from the start of the consortium will allow us to modify the fieldwork in the light of identified model-data inconsistencies. We will also attempt some innovative experiments, for instance using aircraft to sample the atmosphere for determination of 14C content, a key indicator of soil C turnover. We will work in Sweden and Finland largely, in close collaboration with IPY project 213, ENVISNAR.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The MOPITT launched on the AM-1 platform of NASA's Earth
Observing System (EOS). The AM-1 satellite was placed in a
705km, sun-synchronous orbit with a 10:30am equator crossing
time. MOPITT will measure carbon monoxide and methane in the
troposphere over the entire globe for a period of five years.

Despite the fact that we all live in the troposphere, monitoring
of the tropospheric composition from space has lagged
considerably behind our monitoring of the upper regions of the
earth's atmosphere mainly because of the technical difficulty of
such measurements. The presence of the earth's surface provides
considerable interference to most measurement methodologies and
the presence of clouds further impedes the mission. Overcoming
these problems requires a very precise instrument with a very
high performance.

We want to monitor carbon monoxide and methane because they will
help us understand how the troposphere reacts to various
stimuli. These can range from natural phenomena such as the
growth of forests, through agricultural sources such as rice
paddies, to catastrophic events such as biomass burning. Most of
these sources can, and indeed are, being modified by human
activity on the planet.

Carbon monoxide is particularly interesting because of its
potential for showing us how chemicals are transported in the
troposphere as well as giving us information about chemical
reactions in the troposphere.

Measurements have already shown us the production of carbon
monoxide in biomass burning and its transport by atmospheric
circulation systems. This needs to be understood on a global
scale and incorporated into models of tropospheric transport.

Methane is a greenhouse gas and the major issue here is its
source strength. There are a large number of potential sources,
such as northern wetlands, ruminant animals, and natural gas
leakage. However the actual strength of the individual sources
is very poorly known. Since methane's greenhouse effect is far
stronger than that of the better known carbon dioxide, changes
in methane, although small in themselves, can potentially have a
significant effect on the overall climate system.

Measurements of these gases are made by intercepting the
infra-red radiation coming from the planet and then isolating
the required signals. MOPITT is a nadir sounding instrument
since this gives the maximal chance of avoiding cloud features,
but this implies that it can "see" the surface of the planet and
the desired signals must be seen against the background of the
surface radiation. The field-of-view of MOPITT is 22 x 22km and
it views four fields simultaneously by the use of a 4 x 1 array
of detector elements. The field of view is also continuously
scanned through a swath about 600km wide as the instrument moves
along the orbit increasing both the spatial coverage of the
instrument and the chance of finding gaps in the cloud coverage.

The MOPITT instrument makes use of the principle of correlation
spectroscopy whereby a cell of the gas to be measured is used as
an optical filter in the infra-red to measure the signal from
the same gas in the atmosphere. The amount of gas in the
instrument cell is modulated by varying either the pressure or
the length. In addition to the correlation technique MOPITT
makes use of mechanically cooled detectors and filters (at 100K)
to enhance the overall performance. The use of this cooling
technique, which relies on Stirling Cycle coolers supplied by
British Aerospace, is relatively new in satellite
instrumentation having been used on only two civilian satellite
instruments before. The use of mechanical cooling rather than
stored cryogen or radiative cooling permits a relatively large
amount of cooling - sufficient for both the detectors and the
filter systems - whilst still permitting a five year instrument
life.

The MOPITT science team is international, having members from
Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. The instrument
itself is being constructed by a consortium of Canadian
companies: COMDEV Atlantic of Moncton, BOMEM from Quebec City,
Hughes-Leitz from Midland and SED from Saskatoon. The instrument
is funded by the Space Science Division of the Canadian Space
Agency. The instrument will be tested in the University of
Toronto.

MOPITT completed its Preliminary Design Review in December 1993
and the Critical Design Review is scheduled for April
1995. Instrument delivery will be late in 1996 and the launch of
the AM-1 platform will be in mid- 1998. Discussions are under
way regarding a second copy of the instrument to be launched in
the 2003 time frame to permit the dataset of carbon monoxide and
methane to be extended to ten years to look for long term
effects.

The World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) was a component of the
World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and remains the most ambitious
oceanographic experiment undertaken to-date.

In addition to global observations furnished by satellites,
conventional in-situ physical and chemical observations were made by
nearly 30 nations in 4 of the worlds oceans. At the same time global
numerical ocean models were developed to assimilate these
measurements. This activity continues (2003).

The field phase of the project lasted from 1990-1998 and was followed
by Analysis, Interpretation, Modelling and Synthesis activities. This,
the AIMS phase of WOCE, officially continued to the end of 2002 with
the tasks to be undertaken described in the WOCE AIMS Strategy
document.

The success of WOCE AIMS will have considerable impact on follow on
programmes;- CLIVAR, a global study of ocean climate variability and
predictability, GODAE, the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment,
ARGO a global array of temperature/salinity profiling floats.

CARBOCHANGE will provide the best possible process-based quantification of net ocean carbon uptake under changing climate conditions using past and present ocean carbon cycle changes for a better prediction of future ocean carbon uptake. We will improve the quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical processes (particle flux, ecosystem community structure, lateral advection) and physical processes (overturning circulation, ice cover, mixing) through a combination of observations and models. We will upscale new process understanding to large-scale integrative feedbacks of the ocean carbon cycle to climate change and rising carbon dioxide concentrations. We will quantify the vulnerability of the ocean carbon sources and sinks in a probabilistic sense using cutting edge coupled 
Earth system models under a variety of emission scenarios including climate stabilisation scenarios as required for the 5th IPCC assessment report. The drivers for the vulnerabilities will be identified. The most actual observations of the changing ocean carbon sink will be systematically integrated with the newest ocean carbon models, a coupled land-ocean model, an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, and fully fledged Earth system models through a spectrum of data assimilation methods as well as advanced performance assessment tools. Results will be optimal process descriptions and most realistic error margins for future ocean carbon uptake quantifications with models under the presently available observational evidence. The project will deliver calibrated future evolutions of ocean pH and carbonate saturation as required by the research community on ocean acidification in the EU project EPOCA and further projects in this field. The time history of atmosphere-ocean carbon fluxes past, present and future will be synthesised globally as well as regionally for the transcontinental RECCAP project. Observations and model results will merge into GEOSS/GEO through links with the European coordination action COCOS and will prepare the marine branch of the European Research Infrastructure ICOS. Results of the project will be summarised and forwarded to policy makers working on climate change mitigation through specifically targeted outreach papers.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Three years ago, officials at Dulles Airport conducted a little experiment to improve security on international flights. They wanted most passengers to spend less time in line at checkpoints.

Today, of course, this idea sounds terribly dangerous. Who can afford to worry about passengers’ convenience? Let them wait for hours. Take away those Evians of mass destruction. Last weekend, even reading material became suspect — why would anyone on a six-hour flight need a book anyway? Stop making trouble and watch the movie!

The Dulles experiment was radical even in 2003, when airport screeners thought nothing of making passengers wait while they searched Grandma’s purse for nail scissors. But a few experts wondered if there was a better use of everyone’s time.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Ecologic Role and Distribution Patterns of the Heterotrophic
Planktonic Community from the Rio de la Plata Estuary, Southwestern
Atlantic and Antarctic

During the years 2002 to 2004,we plan to study the ecological role of
nano- and microplanktonic heterotrophic protists (flagellates,
ciliates, dinoflagellates, radiolarians and foraminifers) in
association with picoplanktonic components in the Southwestern
Atlantic (including the Atlantic Sector of the Antarctic Ocean, the
Argentine Sea, and the Rio de la Plata estuary), analyzing the main
specific associations, their distribution patterns and their
relationships with biotic and abiotic environmental
parameters. Materials for this survey, largely available already, are
collected from the icebreaker "Almirante Irizar" (Direccion Nacional
del Antartico; Argentine Sea and Antarctic Ocean), and the BIP
"Capitan Canepa" (Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo
Pesquero; Rio de la Plata estuary) by means of continuous pump and
discrete bottle samplings during the summers of 1999 through 2003. At
oceanographic stations, located at 30ft. intervals, but with a lower
spacing in areas of steep environmental gradients (as indicated by
variables measured continuously or semi-continuously, mainly
temperature and fluorometry), two series of samples will be collected:
one aimed at measurementes of temperature, salinity, nutrients, pico-
and nanoplankton, and the second for studies of the
microzooplankton. Preservation of these materials will follow
different protocols, according to the purpose of the sample (taxonomic
identifications, cell counts, etc.). Through epifluorescence
techniques we will emphasize the analysis of the specific composition
and the numerical abundance of one of the least known size fractions
in this area: the nanozooplankton, including its trophic affinities
and factors that favor mixotrophy.

Microzooplankton will be examined and counted under the inverted
microscope using the Utherm?l method. Situ-derived information,
complemented with laboratory grazing experments, will furnish an
integrated picture of the structure and dynamics of the
microheterotrophic plankton that contributes to the "biological pump"
in the area.

Resumen del Proyecto: Se estudiara el rol ecologico de los protozoos
heterotroficos nano y microplanctonicos en relacion con los
componentes picoplanctonicos del Atlantico Sudoccidental y Antartico,
analizando sus asociaciones especificas, sus patrones distributivos y
sus dependencias de los parametros bioticos y abioticos. El material,
en gran parte ya disponible, es colectado por los buques "Almirante
Irizar" (DNA; Mar Argentino y Oceano Antartico) y BIP "Capitan Canepa"
(INIDEP; estuario del Rio de la Plata) mediante muestreos continuos
con bomba de succion y con botellas oceanograficas, durante los
veranos 1999 a 2003. En cada estacion oceanografica se colectaran dos
series de muestras, que seran preservadas segun diferentes protocolos:
la primera destinada para las determinaciones de salinidad,
nutrientes, pico y nanoplancton, y la segunda para el estudio de la
fraccion microzooplanctonica. Mediante la aplicacion de t?cnicas de
epifluorescencia se realizara la evaluacion numerica del
nanozooplancton, incluyendo el estudio de sus afinidades troficas y de
los factores que favorecen la mixotrofia. El microzooplancton sera
cuantificado bajo microscopio invertido (tecnica de Uthermol).

La informacion obtenida in situ, sera complementada con experimentos
de pastoreo en laboratorio, aportando una vision integral de la
estructura y dinamica de los componentes microheterotroficos
planctonicos que contribuyen a la "bomba biologica" en el area.

Unlike earlier AOGCMs at the Hadley Centre and elsewhere (including its predecessor HadCM2), HadCM3 does not need flux adjustment (additional "artificial" heat and freshwater fluxes at the ocean surface) to produce a good simulation. The higher ocean resolution of HadCM3 is a major factor in this; other factors include a good match between the atmospheric and oceanic components; and an improved ocean mixing scheme (Gent and McWilliams). HadCM3 has been run for over a thousand years, showing little drift in its surface climate.

HadCM3 is composed of two components: the atmospheric model HadAM3 and the ocean model (which includes a sea ice model). Simulations often use a 360-day calendar, where each month is 30 days.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
After a decade of fully operational functioning, the DORIS space
geodesy system has demonstrated its capabilities for
orbitography and navigation of the satellites and also ground
location. It plays a key rule in the Topex/Poseidon altimetric
mission for oceanography providing in association with the Laser
technique a 2 cm accuracy in the radial component of the
orbit. DORIS and Laser are renewed as the nominal orbitographic
system for the Jason mission (end of 2000).

DORIS also provides with Diode navigator on Spot 4 (1993), an
orbit in real time within a few meters. It's a world first at
this level of precision.

Since 1994 and thanks to its more than fifty permanent beacon
network, DORIS contributes to the IERS activities for the
realization and maintenance of the ITRS (International
Terrestrial Reference System). 3D positions and velocities of
the reference sites at a cm and mm/yr accuracy lead to
scientific studies (investigations) in the fields of global and
regional tectonics. Two recent DORIS results appear very
encouraging for the future. One concerns a seasonal effect of
earth surface fluid mass redistribution (oceanic water,
atmospheric masses, snow, ...) on the relative positions of the
earth mass and earth figure centers. Another concerns vertical
displacement of the crust monitored near tides-gages. This
information is of major interest for the topic of sea level
variations and correlation to the Global Change.

Such as the other space geodesy techniques GPS, VLBI, SLR, there
is a strong demand among the scientific community to create an
International DORIS Service, so called IDS. The CSTG, commission
for international co-ordination of space techniques for geodesy
of the International Association Geodesy (IAG) and the IERS
directing board decided in July 1999 to initiate a DORIS Pilot
Experiment. Its objective is to assess the need and feasibility
of an International DORIS Service.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Project Background NASA/UDSA MOU:
	
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to strengthen future collaboration. In support of this collaboration, NASA and the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) jointly funded a new project to assimilate NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and products into an existing decision support system (DSS) operated by the International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) of FAS. Building on NASA's investment in the MODIS Science Team, the project is implementing a user-friendly system that will allow for the integration and analysis of MODIS data products in IPAD's DSS.

FAS Mission and Tasks:
	
FAS promotes the security and stability of U.S. food supply, improves foreign market access for U.S. agricultural products, reports on world food security, and advises the U.S. government on international food aid requirements.

FAS bears the primary responsibility for USDA's overseas activities: market development, international trade agreements and negotiations, and the collection and analysis of statistics and market information. It also administers USDA's export credit guarantee and food aid programs, and helps increase income and food availability in developing nations by mobilizing expertise for agriculturally led economic growth.

IPAD's Scope:
	
The FAS, through IPAD, provides agricultural information for global food security. It produces objective, timely and regular assessments of global agricultural production outlook and the conditions affecting food security. IPAD is responsible for global crop condition assessments and estimates of production and yield of grains, oilseeds, and cotton. IPAD assessments are an integral component of the monthly crop assessments issued by USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board - a primary source for agricultural information worldwide.
	
The Application of NASA EOS MODIS Data to FAS Agricultural Assessment and Forecasting:
	
To meet its objectives, FAS/IPAD uses satellite data and data products to monitor agriculture worldwide and to locate and keep track of natural disasters such as short and long term droughts, floods and persistent snow cover which impair agricultural productivity. FAS is the largest user of satellite imagery in the non-military sector of the U.S. government. For the last 20 years FAS has used a combination of Landsat and NOAA-AVHRR satellite data to monitor crop condition and report on episodic events.

FAS is upgrading and enhancing the satellite component of its IPAD decision support system through an information delivery system for MODIS data and derived products. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board two platforms of the Earth Observing System (EOS), was designed in part to monitor subtle vegetation responses to stress, vegetation production and land cover with regional-to-global coverage. Hence, integration of MODIS data and derived products into the IPAD FAS DSS provides FAS with better characterization of land surface conditions at the regional scale and enables monitoring of changes in the key agricultural areas of FAS focus regions in a more timely fashion and at a higher resolution than previously possible with NOAA-AVHRR data.

MODIS: An Operational Prototype: 
	
Although MODIS is a NASA experimental mission, the instrument's capabilities will be extended by the launch of the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in 2008, part of the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), which will become fully operational in 2009. Thus the methods and system developed through this research project can be transitioned into a fully operational domain. 

Project Components:

- Delivery and integration of MODIS Rapid Response data into the FAS monitoring system to facilitate improved monitoring of the impact of climate hazards, such as drought, large scale flooding, and snow storms, on agricultural production.

- Development and delivery of a long term database of MODIS composite Vegetation Index (VI) time series including analysis tools and a graphic user interface that provides mosaicking, reprojection capabilities, and easy access to the moderate resolution image archive.

- Establishment of the relationship between MODIS VI data and the long-term archives from the AVHRR and SPOT-VEGETATION used by FAS/IPAD.

- Development of enhanced MODIS cropland products including a crop mask, a crop type map, new band combination products, and a crop stress index.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
Project MOHAVE was an extensive monitoring, modeling, and data
assessment project designed to estimate the contributions of the
Mohave Power Plant (MPP) to haze at the Grand Canyon National Park
(GCNP). The field study component of the project was conducted in 1992
and contained two intensive monitoring periods (~30 days in the winter
and ~50 days in the summer). Unique, non-depositing, non-reactive
perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) materials were continuously released from
the MPP stack during the two intensive periods to enable the tracking
of emissions specifically from MPP. Tracer, ambient particulate
composition, and SO2 concentrations were measured at about 30
locations in a four-state region.  Two of these monitoring sites, Hopi
Point (HOPO) near the main visitor center at the south rim of the
canyon and Meadview (MEAD) near the far western end of the national
park were used as key receptor sites representative of GCNP.

Project MOHAVE operated under the joint technical and program
management of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Southern
California Edison (SCE) in close partnership with the National Park
Service (NPS). Numerous other organizations contributed to the
operations and assessment work of the project. Since the end of the
field study component of the project, data assessment and modeling
efforts were undertaken by the many participants and have led to
numerous papers and reports. By design these efforts have been the
products of their respective authors and have not been endorsed as
findings of Project MOHAVE.

The primary goal of Project MOHAVE was to determine the contribution
of the MPP emissions to haze at GCNP and other nearby mandatory Class
I areas where visibility is an important air quality related
value. Secondary goals included an increased knowledge of the
contributions of other sources to haze in GCNP and the southwestern
United States in general.  The specific objectives to accomplish these
goals were:

      1.Evaluate the measurements for applicability to modeling and
      data analysis activities.

      2.Describe the visibility, air quality and meteorology during
      the field study period and to determine the degree to which
      these measurements represent typical visibility events at the
      Grand Canyon.

      3.Further develop conceptual models of physical and chemical
      processes which affect visibility impairment at the Grand
      Canyon.

      4.Estimate the contributions from different emissions sources to
      visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon, and quantitatively
      evaluate the uncertainties of those estimates.

      5.Reconcile different scientific interpretations of the same
      data and present this reconciliation to policy-makers

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">AIM is the first satellite mission dedicated to the study of noctilucent or “night-shining” clouds (NLCs) also called Polar Mesospheric clouds (PMCs). It has provided the first global-scale view of the clouds over the entire 2007 Northern Hemisphere season with an unprecedented resolution of 5 km by 5 km and is nearing completion of observations in the Southern Hemisphere season. Despite a significant increase in PMC research in recent years, relatively little is known about the basic physics of these clouds at ”the edge of space” and why they are changing. They have increased in brightness over time, are being seen more often and appear to be occurring at lower latitudes than ever before. The overall goal of the baseline mission is to determine why PMCs form and vary. Since the launch of AIM on April 25, 2007, significant progress has been made in achieving this goal and that progress continues at a rapid rate. The AIM data is of very high quality and has changed our view of PMCs and their environment after only one northern hemisphere (NH) season of observations. The startling similarity between the PMC structure observed by CIPS and that seen in tropospheric clouds suggests that the mesosphere may share some of the same dynamical processes responsible for weather near Earth’s surface. If this similarity holds up in further analysis, it introduces an entirely different view of potential mechanisms responsible for PMC formation and variability. 

AIM has provided the most detailed picture of NH clouds ever collected:

- The clouds appear every day, are widespread and are highly variable on hourly to daily time scales.
- PMC brightness varies over horizontal scales of a few kilometers, and because of the AIM high horizontal resolution, we now know that over small regions the clouds are ten times brighter than measured by previous space-based instruments.
- A previously suspected, but never before seen, population of very small ice particles was measured that is believed to be responsible for strong radar echoes from the summertime mesosphere.
- Mesospheric ice occurs in one continuous layer extending from below the main peak at 83 km up to around 90 km.
- Mesospheric cloud structures, resolved for the first time by the CIPS imager, exhibit complex features present in normal tropospheric clouds.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: Reindeer herdring and climate change (EALAT)
Project URL: http://www.ip-ipy.org/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=399

Reindeer Herders Vulnerability Study (EALÀT) focuses on adaptive capacity of reindeer pastoralism to climate change and variability and, in particular, on the integration of reindeer herders traditional knowledge in the study and analysis of their ability to adapt to environmental variability and change. 
Nomadic reindeer herding practices, ancient in origin, represent models in the sustainable exploitation and management of northern terrestrial ecosystems that is based on generations of experience accumulated, conserved, developed and adapted to the climatic and administrative systems of the north. Reindeer herders traditional knowledge needs to be documented now before much of their understanding is lost due to societal/cultural transformations associated with globalization. Reindeer herding is the geographically most extensive form of animal husbandry in the Eurasian Arctic and sub-Arctic. Some 3 million reindeer provide the basis of the livelihood of herders and hunters in over 20 ethnic groups, managing pasture areas of 4 mill km2 which recently have become extremely important for other industrial interests (chiefly oil and gas development). 
Reindeer have major cultural and economic significance for indigenous peoples of the north. The human-ecological systems in the North, like reindeer pastoralism, are sensitive to change, perhaps more than in virtually any other region of the globe, due in part to the variability of the Arctic climate and the characteristic ways of life of indigenous Arctic peoples. High sensitivity not withstanding, little is known about the vulnerability of such systems to change. Understanding and measuring vulnerability requires assessment of systems ability to adapt to impact and the extent to which freedom to adapt is constrained. EALÀT will therefore also examine the current state and changes of the polar environment (IPY theme 1 and 2). The network will examine traditional knowledge to adaptation in, and the vulnerability of reindeer pastoralism in case studies in Sapmi, Nenetsia, Yamal, Sakha, and Chukotka to change. It will explore (i) the influence of climate variability and change on reindeer, reindeer pastoralism and herding societies and (ii) the extent to which institutions and governance constrain, or create opportunities in, herders ability to cope with and to adapt to the effects of climate change. In addition, because many key institutions, markets, and governance affecting reindeer herders are based outside the Arctic, there are societal polar-global linkages superimposed upon the climate system and biogeochemical linkages (IPY theme 3). The limits of the adaptive capacity of reindeer husbandry must be defined, documented and explored together with the potential role of herders traditional understanding of, and techniques for, reducing their vulnerability for the effects of climate change. 

The IPY EALÀT-network study follows up the Arctic Council ACIA report (Arctic Council 2004: Arctic Climatic Impact Assessment). The philosophy underlying EALÀT is wholly consistent with the recommendations of the ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council at Iceland on 24. November 2004. The Council agreed that warming of the Arctic is occurring faster than previously thought and that indigenous peoples will experience substantial challenges to their economies and cultures as a result. It is therefore important to focus, as does EALÀT, on the ability of reindeer herders to respond to these changes. 

We believe that valuing traditional and scientific knowledge equally and, hence, integrating herders experience and competence within the scientific method will enable us to contribute towards reducing the vulnerability of reindeer husbandry to the effects of climate change. Local effects of warming of the global climate during the next 30 to 50 years are likely to be pronounced over reindeer pastures in the north. EALÀT will adopt a novel methodological approach, focusing on documentation, research, monitoring, outreach and communication. 

We recognise that the ability to adapt to change is based on knowledge embodied in herders language, the institutions of herding and the actions of individual herders. International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry in Kautokeino will be responsible for EALÀT-outreach and communication while the Saami University College will play a lead in coordinating the research in IPY theme 6 Human society in Polar Regions. Its approach is holistic, integrating social and natural science and reindeer herders understanding in the co-production of knowledge. EALÀT will, by this means, contribute to building local competence in the indigenous peoples societies.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) was conducted
in June 1992 off North Africa in the area of Azores and Madeira
Islands. ASTEX was based on two islands and several ships in an area
where the total cloud cover (mostly stratocumulus) ranges from 50 -
60%. The region is dominated by low-level clouds with moderate optical
thicknesses, from about 1 to 10 on average. The optically thinner
(more highly broken) clouds generally have cloud tops below the 800 mb
level). The optically thicker clouds have lower top pressures down to
about 700 mb. The region is characterized by broken low cloudiness and
strong gradients of low level cloud amount. Satellite studies show
cloud conditions ranging from solid stratocumulus decks to broken
trade cumulus. The region is not directly influenced by continental
effects, and islands provide suitable sites for surface observations
and aircraft operations. ASTEX was thus able to address issues related
to the stratocumulus to trade-cumulus transition and cloud-mode
selection.

ASTEX involved intensive measurements from several platforms and was
designed to study how the transition and mode selection are affected
by 1) cloud-top entrainment instability, 2) diurnal decoupling and
clearing due to solar absorption, 3) patchy drizzle and a transition
to horizontally inhomogeneous clouds through decoupling, 4) mesoscale
variability in cloud thickness and associated mesoscale circulations,
and 5) episodic strong subsidence lowering the inversion below the
lifting condensation level. From a broader perspective ASTEX was
designed to provide improved dynamical, radiative, and microphysical
models and an improved understanding of the impact of aerosols, cloud
microphysics, and chemistry on large-scale cloud properties.

From a broader perspective ASTEX was designed to provide improved
dynamical, radiative, and microphysical models and an improved
understanding of the impact of aerosols, cloud microphysics, and
chemistry on large-scale cloud properties.

A telescoping approach was used in ASTEX to investigate connections
between scales ranging from microns to thousands of
kilometers. Satellites and upper- level aircraft provided a
description of large-scale cloud features, and instrumented aircraft
flying in the boundary layer and surface- based remote sensing systems
provided a description of the mean, turbulence, and mesoscale
variability in cloud microphysical properties of boundary layer
clouds. A major deficiency of the FIRE observations, however, was an
inadequate definition of the large-scale fields of temperature,
moisture, and winds. This deficiency was removed for ASTEX by making 4
- 8 soundings per day from the surface sites and ships, and including
many of these upper-air observations on the Global Telecommunications
System (GTS) for assimilation into the ECMWF and NMC
analyses. Furthermore, based on the demonstrated utility of
surface-based remote sensing during FIRE (Albrecht et al. 1990), the
use of such systems was expanded during ASTEX.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NSF OPP  Project #0087439

This award supports a project to develop the techniques for separating net
accumulation into precipitation and sublimation in polar firn. The project will
use existing models for firn ventilation and models for the transfer of
chemical species to firn to create an integrated model of vapor and chemical
species transport in firn for suites of species that respond differently to
water mass loss. This forward model will predict the dependence of geochemistry
on water vapor loss. The knowledge gained from these forward models will then
be used to solve an inverse problem to predict the amount of water vapor
sublimation and redeposition based on profiles of geochemistry in firn. This
project is a necessary first step toward inferring precipitation and
evaporation in ancient environments, such as are recorded in ice cores. This
project will serve as the basis for a Ph.D. dissertation for a student under
the direction of the P.I., E.D. Waddington. Determining how to best extract
climate information from firn and ultimately ice cores is the major goal of
this project.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=417

I-TASC is an international network of cultural, scientific and media technology organisations who have in common an interest in the trandisciplinary convergence of art and science. The network seeks to establish in the Arctic and Antarctic the framework conditions for collaborative projects between artists, scientists, tactical media workers and engineers within three major topical fileds i.e. migration, weather and climate and communications. This is envisaged through the installation and maintenance of two mobile open source and creative commons based art and science research facilities in the Arctic and Antarctica between 2007-2009 and further operations in the next decade. We will be also constructing and launching a micro-satellite in the high sun-synchronous elliptical orbit in 2008 to enable research and contact between the two stations and the sharing of sensor data with other IPY clusters. The facility planned for the Arctic Circle is MAKROLAB mkVII, an autonomous, minimal environmental impact communications, research and living unit capable of sustaining up to 8 crew members for long periods of work in isolation/insulation conditions (60-180 days). Onboard renewable-energy systems, bioreactor/biological sewage processing, water recycling systems, satellite and HF communication systems and radar infrastructure, developed during previous manifestations of the project, will be augmented to fully winterize the MAKROLAB and provide its crews with the tools/resources needed to conduct joint or independent work in concentrated polar field-research environments. Operational systems researched/developed during the MAKROLAB Arctic phases will be applied to the design and construction of a new rapid-deployment zero environmental impact polar research station with the working title LADOMIR, which will be tested in Antarctica in the southern summers of 2008 and 2009. LADOMIR is named for the utopian poem written in 1920 by the Russian Futurist Velimir Khlebnikov, which describes the universal landscape of the future through the destruction of the old world and its synthesis in the new. The word is a combination of LAD, meaning both harmony and living creature,and MIR, both peace and world, universe. Adopting the related constructivist notion of FAKTURA, which can be understood as the conferring of tactile and sensorial qualities onto abstract artistic or scientific elements, LADOMIR will be dedicated to producing readable/tangible surfaces which the public will be able to use to reflect on vague or otherwise invisible polar systems and scientific data from Antarctica and the Arctic. Telecommunications, weather and climate systems and migration are seen as three multiple-dynamic global energy systems which can be explored to understand how our planet functions on natural, social and technological levels, and the knowledge inherent in each can in turn be applied as primary sources for new cognitive and evolutionary strategies. We envision the LADOMIR-MAKROLAB interpolar complex to function as an aggregator and visualiser of self produced and IPY share derived data sources in a manner that transverses from the scientific to the artistic and creative and is thus understandable to a different, non scientific public. A very important aspect of the project is to bring the experience and knowledge of indigenous Arctic cultures to the new Antarctic cultures (and vice/versa) through a dynamic, live and archived communications system. Other activities connected to the projects will include the launching and servicing of stratospheric balloons; the development and operation of a fleet of UAV for remote observation; the development of open source software and hardware for data gathering, processing and intuitive display in the arts and sciences; and the development of autonomous, zero-impact sensor and data relay systems.

The Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment (ALE) began in 1978 as a global
network program to provide continuous high-frequency gas
chromatographic measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O),
Chloroflurocarbons CFCl3 (CFC-11), and CF2Cl2 (CFC-12). The network
included observation stations situated at different sites throughout
the world: Cape Grim, Tasmania; Point Matatula, American Samoa; Ragged
Point, Barbados; Cape Meares, Oregon and Adrigole, Ireland.  The ALE
is but one phase of a monitoring network consisting of the Global
Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE) and the Advanced GAGE.  The ALE
phase ended in mid-1986.
The ALE phase (1978-1986) utilized the Hewlett Packard HP5840 gas

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Antarctic permafrost forms an integral part of the terrestrial cryosphere, yet information on its distribution, thickness, age, and physical and geochemical properties is highly fragmented and absent for large sectors of the region. At the same time, active layer and permafrost conditions are increasingly recognized to be highly sensitive to climate change. Such changes can create important responses in regional hydrology, ecosystems functioning, landscape stability and human environmental impacts. At the same time Antarctic permafrost and soils archive high resolution long-term (Ma) records of past environmental change and biological activity.

Objectives
The combined IPA working group on Antarctic Permafrost and SCAR expert group on Antarctic Soils, Permafrost and Periglacial Environments, in close working relationship with the IUSS cryosols group, have launched the ANTPAS project to address some of the current shortcomings and research needs. The overall aim is to develop an internationally coordinated, web-accessible, database and monitoring system on Antarctic permafrost and soils. Specific objectives are:

A common, web-accessible repository for permafrost and soils data.

The production of thematic maps on Antarctic permafrost and soils.

A system of boreholes providing data on permafrost and soils properties, records of past environmental change, and recording permafrost responses to climate change.

A well-designed monitoring system recording active layer and periglacial process responses to climate change along selected environmental gradients. 

ANTPAS is an IPY endorsed activity.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
With the cooperation of the Government of Barbados and with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as lead agency, the
Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX) was
conducted over the tropical Atlantic East of Barbados in the summer of
1969. The field operations for this multiagency national study of the
ocean-atmosphere system were divided into four observation periods:
May 3 to 15, May 24 to June 10, June 19 to July 2, and July 11 to july
28. The first three were devoted to the Sea Air Interaction
Program--the BOMEX 'Core Experiment'--within a 500-km by 500-km square
ship array. During the fourth period, the array was extended southward
to incorporate the Intertropical Convergence Zone.

Following the field operations, the Barbados Oceanographic and
Meteorological Analysis Project (BOMAP) Office was established to
reduce and process the data that had been collected by ship, aircraft,
and land-based acquisition system under the operational control of the
BOMEX Temporary Archive at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in
Asheville, N.C., in 1971.

On July 1,1971, the BOMEX office became the Center for Experiment
Design and Data Analysis (CEDDA) and was subsequently transferred from
NOAA's Environmental Research Laboratories to its Environmental Data
Service. One of the tasks assigned to CEDDA--in addition to its
participation in other field experiments, was to reprocess the BOMEX
data. Final validation of the data was undertaken through detailed
analysis and application of necessary corrections, a task that was
completed in the fall of 1974, when the BOMEX Permanent Archive was
established at NCDC.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">CIBAC is a multi-sectoral organization dedicated towards fighting graft, corruption and cronyism in government. It is made up of people bound together with the common belief that such diseases must be stamped out in order for true national development to commence.

Formed in 1997, CIBAC has grown into a nationwide organization through the efforts of the idealistic and dedicated men and women who compose it. But the fight against corruption is no easy task, it is for this reason that CIBAC continues its invitation for nationalistic, law-abiding and God-fearing citizens to join its cause and contribute towards ensuring a better future for our country.

CIBAC has continuously faced corruption head on. It is instrumental in the filing of cases against erring officials with the Ombudsman and other courts. It has also joined hands with other civic groups as petitioners in filing cases of plunder, graft and corruption, bribery, violations of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for Government Employees, and perjury against known public officials. Primary among these is the impeachment complaint filed against former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada in 2000.

CIBAC has not limited its battle against corruption to the courts though. Since 1998, it has been an active participant in peaceful mass actions and mobilizations to reiterate its stand against all forms of corruption. It also continues to broaden its network of anti-corruption groups and agencies to intensify its campaign against corruption.

As a party-list member in the House of Representatives, CIBAC has taken a more active legislative stand on issues pertaining to good governance, transparency and honesty in the conduct of operations and management of both the public and private sectors, and promotion of the welfare of the marginalized sectors and interest groups, particularly the youth, women, overseas filipino wokers, rural communities, urban poor and labor.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

Scientific Objectives:
The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment I instrument, a Sun
photometer, aboard the Applications Explorer Mission-2 (AEM-2)
satellite began collecting data in October 1979.  The scientific
objective was to develop a global stratospheric aerosol, ozone, and
nitrogen dioxide database that could be used for the investigation of
the spatial and temporal variations of these species caused by
seasonal and short-term meteorological variations, atmospheric
chemistry, microphysics, and transient phenomena such as volcanic
eruptions.  The database could also be used for the study of trends,
atmospheric dynamics and transport, and potential climatic effects.
The SAGE I sensor was designed to measure the attenuation of solar
radiation resulting from atmospheric aerosol, ozone, and nitrogen
dioxide at four spectral regions through the Earth's atmosphere during
each spacecraft sunrise and sunset.
Project Description:
The AEM-2 satellite was placed in an orbit of approximately 600
kilometers at an inclination of 56 degrees to extend the latitudinal
coverage for the solar occultation measurements from 79 degrees South
to 79 degrees North.
The SAGE I instrument consists of four spectral channels centered at
wavelengths of 1000, 600, 450, and 385 nanometers for measuring global
data concerning aerosol vertical extinction profiles, ozone vertical
concentrations profiles, and nitrogen dioxide vertical concentrations
profiles during spacecraft sunrise and sunset.  The solar wavelengths
of 1000 and 450 nanometers are used to generate altitude profiles of
ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentration.  The SAGE I aerosol data
were validated by comparison with correlative lidar and dustsonde in
situ measurements, the ozone data were validated by comparison with
balloon ECC ozonesonde and rocket measurements, and the nitrogen
dioxide measurements were compared with climatology.
The operation of the instrument, during each sunrise and sunset
measurement, was totally automatic.  Prior to each sunrise or sunset,
the instrument was rotated in azimuth to its predicted solar
acquisition position.  When the Sun entered the instrument's field of
view, the instrument adjusted its azimuth position to lock onto the
radiometric center of the Sun to within +/- 45 arcsec and then
acquired the sun by rotating its scan mirror to the proper elevation
angle.  As the Sun traversed between the horizon and the tangent
height of 150 kilometers, radiometric channel data were sampled at a
rate of 64 samples per second per channel, digitized to 12-bit
resolution, and recorded for later transmission back to Earth.
Additional SAGE I instrument information can be found in McCormick et
al (1979).  The SAGE I instrument collected data for almost three
years until the AEM-2 satellite power subsystem failed.
Data Used and Produced:
The SAGE I science and engineering data, along with spacecraft time,
position, and housekeeping data, were stored aboard the spacecraft and
then down linked to NASA GSFC through a ground station.  GSFC then
forwarded these data to LaRC for processing and scientific analysis.
GSFC also sent spacecraft and solar ephemeris data to LaRC on separate
weekly tapes.
LaRC combines three data sources to produce the SAGE I MERDAT: (1) the
SAGE I instrument data, (2) the spacecraft and solar ephemeris data,
and (3) NOAA NMC temperature and density interpolations from the
standard NMC spatial gridded analyses at the 18 standard pressure
levels and at the tropopause for each tangent event location.
The MERDAT files are used as the data input to the inversion process.
At the completion of the data processing, three Level 2 SAGE I
products are produced: aerosol extinction profiles, ozone
concentration profiles, and nitrogen dioxide concentration profiles.
The SAGE1_AERO_PRF_NAT data set contains three years of aerosol
extinction profiles data.  Each granule consists of three months of
data (seasonal data) which is in the SAGE I's native binary format.
The data coverage begins February 1979 and extends through November
1981.  Data are stored in event format.  Each measurement event
consists of 48 parameters (does not include spares).
The SAGE1_AERO_PRF data set contains three years of aerosol extinction
profiles data.  Each granule consists of one month of data.  These
data are in Hiearchical Data Format (HDF).  The data coverage begins
February 1979 and extends through November 1981.  Data are stored in
parameter format.  Each measurement event consists of 38 parameters.
The Ozone Concentration Profiles data set is not currently available
at the Langley DAAC.  It will be archived in Hierarchical Data Format
(HDF).
The Nitrogen Dioxide Concentration Profiles data set is not currently
available at the Langley DAAC.  It will be archived in Hierarchical
Data Format (HDF).

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Superintendent's Report for 1898-99 records an agreement reached by members of the International Geodetic Association to establish six observatories for the purpose of measuring the variations in latitude caused by the earth's wobble on its polar axis. This program, known as the International Polar Motion Service, was initiated in 1899 with the establishment of six stations, all located near the parallel of 39 degrees 08 minutes north latitude (to permit uniform computations), and were at Gaithersburg, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; Ukiah, California; Mizusawa, Japan; Charjui in Russian Turkestan; and Carloforte, Sardinia, Italy. Economic constraints forced the closing of the Cincinnati observatory in 1932. The Charjui station was lost in World War I, and an observatory was substituted for it at Kitab, near Samarkand in the Soviet Union.

The Gaithersburg Observatory was constructed by Edwin Smith, Chief of the Instrument Division of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (This agency, now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, operated the International Polar Motion Service observatories in the United States.) Between 1891 and 1892 Smith had been conducting measurements of the variation of latitude on a volunteer basis from his home in Rockville, Maryland, and made nearly 1800 individual measurements on 146 nights, until his regular work forced him to discontinue his observations. However, when the International Geodetic Association allocated funds for the purchase of land in Gaithersburg in 1898, Smith was entrusted with the construction of the Gaithersburg Observatory, which began operating on October 18, 1899.

The original six observatories around the world worked in close concert carrying out a program of star study selected by Dr. Kimura, the astronomer in charge of the Mizusawa station. Twelve groups of stars, each containing six pairs of stars, were selected. Two groups of stars were observed each night at each station in accordance with a schedule of dates, time, and duration prepared by Dr. Kimura. The irregular daily motion of the earth's axis was believed to be extremely small, but the extent could be determined by the precise measurements of the stars. The six stations worked documenting the data to support latitude variations until 1914. Economic constraints forced the closing of the Gaithersburg and Cincinnati stations in 1915. During World War I contact was lost with the Charjui station. When communication with the Russian observers was resumed, the association learned that star movement data had been recorded through 1919. After World War I the Soviets continued to participate in this program with the establishment of a new station in Kitab in Uzbekistan, USSR.

While the Cincinnati station remained closed and was eventually dismantled, the Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory resumed operations in 1932. Upon reopening, it functioned continually in cooperation with its sister observatories through out the world until computerization rendered its use obsolete in 1982.

The scientific work conducted at the Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory illustrates the systematic approach sought by the International Geodetic Association to measure the degree of "wobble" occurring on the earth' s north-south axis. Although superseded by newer technologies using satellite observations the wealth of data returned from Gaithersburg and the other five observatories is used by scientists today to determine polar motion; the size, shape and physical properties of the earth; to predict climate and earthquakes; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites.

The city of Gaithersburg designated the observatory as a local historic site in December 1983. In July 1985 the site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The observatory property was conveyed to the city of Gaithersburg in May 1987 by the federal government, with the proviso that it be preserved as a historic monument and used for the benefit of the public. At the present time the city of Gaithersburg plans to restore the latitude observatory and build a science education center, on the site of the caretaker's house, for the use of the school children of Gaithersburg.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Eastern Atlantic Experiment was a part of the Marine Aerosol and
Gas Exchange (MAGE) component of the Atmospheric Chemistry Studies in
the Oceanic Environment (ACSOE) project.

The aims of the experiment were:

To quantify input of DMS into a parcel of air

To examine the oxidation of DMS and its reaction with nitrogen species
with time

To investigate the formation of new particles as a result of these
transformations

To discriminate between the natural and anthropogenic fractions of
sulphur and nitrogen using isotopic measurements

The experiment included two campaigns in the spring seasons of 1996
and 1997, each of which incorporated three elements:

A land-based site at Mace Head (at the seaward end of Galway Bay)
A research vessel operating off the west coast of Ireland (RRS Challenger)

Research aircraft overflights to link shipborne and land-based measurements

The primary measurements made during the campaigns were concentrations
of DMS in the atmosphere and the water column, but a wide range of
additional measurements were made including:

Atmospheric ozone and nitrogen species
Atmospheric particulates and their chemistry
Atmospheric nitrogen and sulphur isotopic composition
Oceanic temperature, salinity, attenuance and chlorophyll
Meteorology

The fieldwork was supported by modelling work with a zero-dimensional
time-dependent photochemical box model of an air mass in the marine
boundary layer.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Water Vapor Sensing System</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Water Vapor Sensing System (WVSS) was used for obtaining
weather observations which was a revolution in that it used a
convenient platform for a variety of environmental parameters.

History:

The FAA interest in the WVSS program is to support the Aviation
Weather Research Program. Researchers will use the data to
improve algorithms for the detection, analysis and prediction of
mesoscale weather phenomena and activity which affects the
aviation industry: ceiling and visibility, precipitation type
and amount, thunderstorms, microbursts, and icing. Two other
areas where water vapor has a secondary role are in convective
turbulence (where water vapor gradients affect atmospheric
stability) and in flight-level winds where the synoptic scale
wind patterns are often significantly disrupted by mesoscale
outflow (where water vapor plays a role in mesoscale development
and decay).

Program:

Results of the first phase of evaluation of the WVSS-I, which
uses a thin-film capacitor to measure relative humidity, are
available from this web site under the document entitled "Water
Vapor Profiles from Commercial Aircraft".  THese results include
evaluation of measurements from the six UPS B-757 aircraft that
had the Allied Signal avionics and the WVSS-I software.  Results
from six months of data (July 1, 1999 to December 31, 1999) from
these WVSS-I equipped aircraft reveal that the commercial
aircraft profiles are competitive with radiosondes on
ascent/descent and superior to radiosondes in the upper
troposphere.

Comparisons of opportunity with radiosondes (when equipped
aircraft made ascent/descents near a radiosonde site) also
revealed the capability of depicting the moist absolutely
unstable layers (MAULs) describe by Bryan and Fritsch (2000).
See the document above for the detailed reference.  A number of
examples of MAULs including those seen in radiosondes are shown
in this document.  Statistics on the occurrence of MAULs (in the
commercial aircraft data and in radiosondes) are also provided.

Data from the second phase of the WVSS-I evaluation (after the
new Teledyne avionics equipment had replaced the Allied Signal
avionics is available to users as describe below.  One of the
limitations of the WVSS-I technology ( the Vaisala thin-film
capacitor technology which was an improved version over that
same sensor used in Vaisala radiosondes) is the "aging" of the
sensor over time.  This aging eventually results in a dry-bias
over time -- requiring that the sensor be replaced and then
recalibrated.

Note that such aging takes place while the unit sits on a shelf
(although presumably at a slower pace than when it is in
operation on the aircraft). THere is considerable variability in
this aging process -- this being one of the major reasons for
abandoning this sensor for the WVSS-II sensor described below.

As the WVSS-I Program is experimental (not operational) with a
limited budget, these sensors were not immediately replaced when
they should have been -- instead, part of the evaluation process
was to see how long the sensors would last.  Thus, Table 1 below
shows those time periods when the 30 UPS aircraft were
installed, working, and did not exhibit the obvious dry-bias.
This table will be maintained on a monthly basis through
calendar year 2002.  The green-filled boxes are the months with
good data.

Sensing System Program at "http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/wvss/"

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Seasonal Ecological Analysis of Seafloor Organic Nutrient Supplies (SEASONS) is an ongoing study to investigate the impact of seasonality on benthic foraminiferal communities of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The WAP, in particular the northern Gerlache-southern Bransfield Straits, displays strong seasonality in primary productivity due largely to seasonal sea ice conditions and light availability. These extremes in primary productivity result in significant differences in organic flux to the sea floor. Cruises SEASONS I and II were devoted to sampling surface and near surface sediments in mid-April and late June, 2008 for foraminiferal, sedimentological, pore water, and geochemical analyses. Samples were collected across a productivity gradient, and at shallow (~600 meters) and deep (~1200 meters) water depths in the northern Gerlache-southern Bransfield Straits. Foraminiferal samples were treated to identify specimens containing protoplasm (living) at the time of collection with a protein marker, CellTracker Green and biological stain, Rose Bengal. Foraminiferal samples will be used to determine the seasonal impact on the population dynamics of the foraminiferal communities, and to assess seasonal impact on the geochemical properties of the biogenic carbonate. Additional samples were collected for organic carbon and sedimentological analyses. Pore waters were collected from the sediments for geochemical analyses. Results of these analyses will further our understanding of the environmental controls on foraminiferal geochemistry and distributions, extensively used proxies for paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic interpretations.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes
EXperiment (VORTEX) will be held in the central and southern
Plains during the spring seasons of 1994 and 1995. Broadly
stated, this experiment is designed to address current research
questions relating to tornadogenesis and tornado dynamics. It
will be hosted by the National Severe Storms Laboratory, and
will involve the collaboration of the University of Oklahoma and
the Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS),
Texas A&amp;M University, the University of Illinois, Texas Tech
University, New Mexico Tech, the University of West Virginia,
the University of Alabama at Huntsville, the University of
California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Science Foundation
(NSF), NOAA/NWS (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration/National Weather Service), and Atmosphere
Environment Service (AES; Canada).

The primary benefit of VORTEX will be the new knowledge
generated through careful analysis of the data sets obtained
during the field experiments. This new knowledge should lead to
some very practical benefits.

This experiment is being executed with a set of specific
scientific hypotheses in mind, as documented elsewhere ( "
Scientific Objectives" ), but the general sense of the
experiment is to increase understanding of tornadogenesis,
thereby enhancing the ability to anticipate tornado
development. Many of the scientific objectives are closely tied
to the mission statement of SELS (soon to become SPC). With the
deployment of Doppler radars around the nation, it is becoming
increasingly obvious that (1) even this exciting new tool has
some limits in its tornado detection capability, as do all
weather radars, and (2) not all mesocyclonic circulations
detectable by a Doppler radar will become tornadic. Since not
all detectable mesocyclones go on to produce tornadoes, it is
quite crucial to tornado warning operations at the WFO level
(in the reorganized NWS) that we have some means to distinguish
tornadic from non-tornadic circulations (as seen on a
WSR-88D). Otherwise, excessive fal!  se alarms could damage NWS
credibility. Tornadoes produced from non-mesocyclonic storms,
about which we hope to learn in VORTEX, are another challenge
with direct application to operations.

In the warning process, it is not only important to know if a
tornado is about to form, but also to be able to predict when
the tornado will dissipate. VORTEX is designed to acquire new
information that may allow users of WSR-88D data to interpret
radar signatures to diagnose tornado dissipation, and to predict
the formation of additional tornadoes in cyclic storms.

In the process, an important issue becomes the interaction
between the potentially tornadic storm and its
environment. Modelling work (numerical and mathematical) and
some limited observational studies have suggested some ways to
distinguish tornado-prone environments from those that are not,
but these concepts have yet to be given an adequate test. Given
that the detection of a potentially tornadic storm is more
likely when the forecasters have anticipated such a possibility
than when they have not, the VORTEX operating plan also includes
some experimental forecasting techniques that may become
prototypes for how operational tornado forecasting will be done
in the future. Preventing false alarms is just as important as
not missing important events. Many of the hypotheses being
investigated in VORTEX are designed to resolve these important
issues and explore new methods for dealing with the tornado
problem.

Especially exciting will be the incorporation of some
experimental numerical modelling on the mesoscale and the storm
scale, with the participation of CAPS (Center for the Analysis
and Prediction of Storms, affiliated with the University of
Oklahoma). Operational implementation of such numerical models
is in its infancy, but it appears quite likely that mesoscale
and storm scale models will eventually have some role in
operations. By participating in VORTEX, a number of NWS
forecasters from the NOC and the SPC will have a chance to
experiment with using such forecasting input. This gives those
individuals an opportunity to have input on how such models
will be implemented in the future, based on their
experiences. A continuing problem with introduction of new
technology is that forecasters often have so little experience
with the new systems that they have no chance to influence the
acquisition and evolution of the new technological tools until
very late in the game. By bein!  g involved with VORTEX, the
participating forecasters (and their associated agencies) have
a real chance to affect the implementation of new forecasting
techniques and technology.

Similar benefits accrue for the participating forecasters (and,
their associated agencies within the NWS) as a result of
interacting with the principal scientific investigators. This is
especially important for the OUN NOC by virtue of their combined
research-operations mission. By their involvement, contact by
the NWS with the leading scientists in the area gives the NWS an
opportunity to (a) learn about what the research community is
doing in this topic area, and (b) offer their insights about
what problems the NWS is encountering. This experiment is an
ideal venue for encouraging research-operations interaction that
can only benefit all of the agencies involved.

Finally, the new knowledge we hope to gain through VORTEX
tornado dynamics studies should enable structural engineers to
establish improved design standards to mitigate tornado damage.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Space Shuttle Endeavour</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Endeavour, the last addition to the orbiter fleet, is named after the first ship commanded by James Cook, the 18th century British explorer, navigator and astronomer. On Endeavour's maiden voyage in August 1768, Cook sailed to the South Pacific (to observe and record the infrequent event of the planet Venus passing between the Earth and the sun). Determining the transit of Venus enabled early astronomers to find the distance of the sun from the Earth, which then could be used as a unit of measurement in calculating the parameters of the universe. In 1769, Cook was the first person to fully chart New Zealand (which was previously visited in 1642 by the Dutchman Abel Tasman from the Dutch province of Groningen). Cook also surveyed the eastern coast of Australia , navigated the Great Barrier Reef and traveled to Hawaii.

Cook's voyage on the Endeavour also established the usefulness of sending scientists on voyages of exploration. While sailing with Cook, naturalist Joseph Banks and Carl Solander collected many new families and species of plants, and encountered numerous new species of animals.

Endeavour and her crew reportedly made the first long-distance voyage on which no crewman died from scurvy, the dietary disease caused by lack of ascorbic acids. Cook is credited with being the first captain to use diet as a cure for scurvy, when he made his crew eat cress, sauerkraut and an orange extract.

The Endeavour was small at about 368 tons, 100 feet in length and 20 feet in width. In contrast, its modern day namesake is 78 tons, 122 feet in length and 78 feet wide. The Endeavour of Captain Cook's day had a round bluff bow and a flat bottom. The ship's career ended on a reef along Rhode Island.

For the first time, a national competition involving students in elementary and secondary schools produced the name of the new orbiter; it was announced by President George Bush in 1989. The Space Shuttle orbiter Endeavour was delivered to Kennedy Space Center in May 1991, and flew its first mission, highlighted by the dramatic rescue of a stranded communications satellite, a year later in May 1992.

In the day-to-day world of Shuttle operations and processing, Space Shuttle orbiters go by a more prosaic designation. Endeavour is commonly refered to as OV-105, for Orbiter Vehicle-105. Empty Weight was 151,205 lbs at rollout and 172,000 lbs with main engines installed.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">      To address a growing need for remote access to high volume
      numerical weather prediction and global climate models and
      data, the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), along with the
      National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the
      Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), initiated the
      NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS)
      project. The NOMADS framework was developed to facilitate
      climate model and observational data inter-comparison issues as
      discussed in documents such as the Intergovernmental Panel on
      Climate Change (IPCC 1990, 1995, 2001) and the U.S. National
      Assessment (2000). NOMADS is being developed as a Unified
      Climate and Weather Archive to provide Web access to model
      information so that users can make decisions about their
      specific needs. This on time scales from days (weather), to
      months (El Nino), to decades (global warming). NOMADS also
      addresses model data access needs as outlined in the
      U.S. Weather Research Program (U!  SWRP) Implementation Plan
      for Research in Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting and Data
      Assimilation to "redeem practical value of research findings
      and facilitate their transfer into operations." For more
      information see: The NOMADS Program Overview.
      
      NOMADS is a network of data servers using established and
      emerging technologies to access and integrate model and other
      data stored in geographically distributed repositories in
      heterogeneous formats. NOMADS enables the sharing and
      inter-comparing of model results and is a major collaborative
      effort, spanning multiple Government agencies and academic
      institutions. The data available under the NOMADS framework
      include model input and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)
      gridded output models from NCEP; and Global Climate Models
      (GCM) and simulations from GFDL and other leading institutions
      from around the world. The goals of NOMADS are to:
      
      1.Improve access to NWP and GCM's datasets.
      
      2.Improve the linkages between the research and operational
      modeling communities.
      
      3.Foster collaborations between the climate and weather
      communities.  Provide the observational data and model analysis
      initialization products for regional models.
      
      4.Improve the verification process of forecast and climate
      models.  Promote product development and collaborations within
      the geo-science communities (ocean, weather, and climate).
      
      5.Provides cost effective pull technologies for "hyper-slabs"

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/GUIDE/campaign_documents/sam2_project.html

Scientific Objectives:
      
The Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM) II instrument, aboard the Earth-orbiting Nimbus 7 spacecraft, was designed to measure solar irradiance attenuated by aerosol particles in the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere.  The scientific objective of the SAM II experiment was to develop a stratospheric aerosol data base for the polar regions by measuring and mapping vertical profiles of the atmospheric extinction due to aerosols.  This data base allows for studies of aerosol changes due to seasonal and short-term meteorological variations, atmospheric chemistry, cloud microphysics, volcanic activity and other perturbations.  The results obtained are useful in a number of applications, particularly the evaluation of any potential climatic effect caused by stratospheric aerosols. 
 
Project Description: The SAM II instrument consists of a single-channel Sun photometer with a 0.04 micron passband centered at a wavelength of 1.0 micron.  This is a region of the spectrum where absorption by atmospheric gases is negligible; consequently, any attenuation of sunlight is due to scattering by aerosol particles and air molecules. In operation, the instrument is activated shortly before each sunrise or sunset encountered by the satellite.  A sensor with a wide field-of-view is used to indicate the Sun's presence.  Two similar sensors then point the SAM II to within +-0.03 degrees in azimuth (left and right).  A mirror begins a rapid vertical scan until the Sun's image is acquired by the SAM II telescope.  The mirror then slowly scans vertically across the Sun at a rate of 0.25 degree per second reversing itself each time a Sun-limb crossing occurs.  The entrance window to the SAM II telescope only passes sunlight of wavelengths greater than 0.9 micron.  A circular aperture placed at the image plane serves to define the instantaneous field of view of the instrument to be 0.5 minute of arc.  This corresponds to a vertical resolution in the atmosphere of approximately 0.5 km altitude.  From the telescope, the light is directed through an interference filter, which rejects all but the 1.0 micron wavelength (+-0.02 micron) passband, to a photodiode detector.  The solar intensity as a function of time is digitized, recorded, and periodically telemetered back to Earth.  A description of the SAM II instrument, and of the experiment in general, is given by McCormick et al.  (1979).  The SAM II instrument, along with a number of other sensors, is mounted on the Nimbus 7 Earth-orbiting spacecraft.  The orbital characteristics of this spacecraft determine the frequency and geographic locations of the SAM II measurements.  The mode of operation of the SAM II instrument is such that it takes data during each sunrise and sunset encountered.  The Nimbus 7 spacecraft has an orbital period of 104 minutes, which means that it circles the Earth nearly 14 times per day.  There is a measurement opportunity for the SAM II each time that the spacecraft enters into or emerges from the Earth's shadow.  Consequently, the instrument takes data during approximately 14 sunrises and 14 sunsets each Earth day.  The Nimbus 7 spacecraft was placed in a high-noon, Sun-synchronous orbit; that is, the spacecraft crossed the Equator during each orbit at local noon. In general terms, this means that the orbital plane of the spacecraft was fixed with respect to the Sun, and thus all sunsets occur in the Arctic region and all sunrises occur in the Antarctic region. In the course of a single day, measurements of the stratospheric aerosol are obtained at 14 points spaced 26 degrees apart in longitude in the Arctic region and similarly for the Antarctic region. All the points obtained during 1 day in a given region are at very nearly the same latitude, but as time progresses, the latitudes of the measurements slowly change with the season by 1 to 2 degrees each week, gradually sweeping out the area from approximately 64.0 to 83.0 degrees.  The lowest latitude coverage occurs at the solstices whereas the highest latitudes are measured at the equinoxes. In the course of 1 week, therefore, the instrument makes about 98 measurements in each region, all in a band of latitude of approximately 1.0 degree.  These measurements give a fairly spatially dense set of data points.  When the locations of all the measurements obtained in one week are plotted on a geographic set of axes, one finds that the separation between points is only about 4.0 degrees in longitude. In a 6-month period of time, the total number of observations is on the order of 5000. However, due to an orbit degradation associated with the Nimbus 7 spacecraft, there has been a change and disruption in the collection of SAM II data beginning in 1987.  During the period of time from 1987 through 1993, orbital precession caused the Nimbus 7 spacecraft to cross the equator earlier than the planned high-noon crossing.  This gradually moved the Antarctic coverage equatorward and the maximum latitudinal Arctic coverage slightly poleward.  Initially the Antarctic latitudinal coverage extended from the lowest latitude, 64.5 degrees at the solstices, to the highest latitude, 81.0 degrees at the equinoxes.  By 1992 the Antarctic coverage gradually shifted to extend from 53.1 degrees at the solstices, to 69.2 degrees at the equinoxes. In the Arctic region the initial latitudinal coverage extended from the lowest latitude, 64.1 degrees at the solstices, to the highest latitude, 83.0 degrees at the equinoxes.  Gradually by 1991 the highest Arctic latitudinal coverage extended to 86.2 degrees at the equinoxes. 

The orbital precession also affected the spacecraft orientation and prevented the SAM II instrument from acquiring the Sun for certain periods of time.  In the Arctic region many sunset events were lost because an S-band antenna blocked SAM II's view to the Sun.  Sunset events were lost for the following periods of time: mid-June through mid-August 1988; mid-March through mid-September 1989; mid-January through September 1990; and from January 7, 1991, through the present. In the Antarctic region the SAM II instrument was not able to acquire the Sun for the period of time from mid-January through October 1993. The final 2 months of SAM II data for the Antarctic region were collected during November and December 1993, and no further data is expected beyond 1993. Data Used and Produced: The SAM II satellite data are processed after being telemetered to the ground, with the data on solar intensity versus time being mathematically inverted to yield extinction coefficient versus altitude (extinction profile) for each sunrise or sunset event.  The mathematical inversion used is described by Chu and McCormick (1979). The basic data product, therefore, is the extinction profile obtained during each measurement opportunity, which can be analyzed to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the upper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosol.  These extinction data are archived at the Langley Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, after being subjected to an extensive validation program including comparisons with correlative aerosol observations.  A detailed description of the archived data products is given in the SAM II Data User's Guide (Chu et al.,1988). The SAM2_AERO_PRF_NAT data set contains over 15 years of polar Arctic and Antarctic aerosol profiles obtained with the SAM II satellite experiment.  The data coverage begins October 1978 and extends through December 1993.  For each measurement event, vertical profiles of extinction km-1, extinction km-1 uncertainty, extinction ratio, extinction ratio uncertainty, NMC temperature, temperature uncertainty, and pressure are provided as a function of altitude. Questionable profiles identified using the procedures described in the SAM II Data User's Guide have been removed from this data set.  In addition, a small number of events displaying incorrect measurement locations were deleted.

The Atmospheric Aerosol Chemical Composition Measurements for the
Subsonic Aircraft: Contrail and Cloud Effects Special Study (SUCCESS)
was an airborne expedition conducted aboard the NASA Ames DC-8
research aircraft during April/May 1996.  The purpose of this project
was to better determine the radiative properties of cirrus clouds and
contrails so that satellite observations can more reliable assess
their impact on the Earth's radiation budget.
The goals of the program included determining how cirrus clouds form,
whether exhaust from subsonic aircraft affects their formation, and if
the changes might be climatologically significant.  Measurements also
were performed to better determine the chemical characteristics of
gaseous and particulate exhaust products from subsonic aircraft and
their temporal evolution in the upper troposphere. The Global
Atmospheric Chemistry Group at the University of New Hampshire is
conducting measurements of the detailed chemical composition of the
atmospheric aerosol. For further information please see

Project URL: http://www.polarcat.no/
Proposal URL:http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=32

The overall objective of POLARCAT, which proposes a coordinated programme of measurements and modelling, is to quantify the impact of trace gases, aerosols and mercury transported to the Arctic and their contribution to pollutant deposition and climate change in the region. POLARCAT has 5 major scientific objectives detailed in a White Paper, see http://zardoz.nilu.no/~andreas/POLARCAT/

1) Quantification of the major transport pathways controlling distributions of oxidants, aerosols, heavy metals together with their precursors/degradation products in the Arctic troposphere during winter-spring when Arctic Haze is prevalent and during summertime. Processes controlling the carbon budget at Northern high latitude forest/tundra/ocean regions will also be investigated.

2) Quantification of the optical properties and direct radiative effects of aerosols and their interactions with clouds and possible impacts on surface albedo and ice/snow cover.

3) Investigation into the influence of summertime boreal forest fires on the composition of the Arctic free troposphere compared to other source regions (e.g. Asia) including the impact of soot deposition on snow/ice albedo. The impact of pyro-convection on the composition/aerosol loading of the lower stratosphere and possible influences on stratospheric ozone depletion will also be investigated.

4) Determination of chemical processes controlling atmospheric composition, particularly during the winter and the spring-summer transition in the Arctic. This will include assessment of the nature and extent of ozone depletion events (link to halogen/mercury cycling) in the boundary layer; quantification of the role of VOCs and oxygenated species, relative roles of dry deposition and wet deposition of soluble species in rain- and snowfall, quantification of sources and sinks of major oxidants such as ozone and PAN including assessment of the odd-nitrogen budget. Also the chemistry and effect of polar air masses on mid- and high latitude particle formation is investigated.

5) Study of processes controlling inter-annual variations in atmospheric composition over the Arctic such as transport patterns (e.g. NAO) and changing emissions in different source regions. The impact of climate change on atmospheric composition and conversely the impact of atmospheric composition change on climate will also be investigated.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">QuakeSim is a project to develop a solid Earth science framework for modeling and understanding earthquake and tectonic processes. The multi-scale nature of earthquakes requires integrating many data types and models to fully simulate and understand the earthquake process. QuakeSim focuses on modeling the interseismic process through various boundary element, finite element, and analytic applications, which run on various platforms including desktop and high end computers.

We integrate and deliver the following data products through our QuakeTables database:

    -paleoseismic fault data
    -surface deformation data in the form of Global Positioning System (GPS) data
    -seismicity data
    -processed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) interferograms from existing satellites (in progress)

Making these data available to modelers is leading to significant improvements in earthquake forecast quality and thereby mitigating the danger from this natural hazard.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">LARC is an acronym, which stands for Laboratorio Antartico de Radiacion Cosmica
(Antarctic Laboratory for Cosmic Rays). LARC project started about ten years
ago as a uniquely Chilean project, but approximately five years ago the
cosmic-ray section of IFSI/CNR was called to collaborate with the Chilean
researchers both for experimental and theoretical works. A detailed Proposal
entitled Cosmic Rays in Antarctica was submitted to the Italian Antarctic
Research Program (PNRA/MURST, 1992-96) and it was approved. The Italian
counterpart joined the project in November 1993 through the signature of a
formal agreement (convention) between the Chilean Laboratory for Cosmic Rays
(University of Chile - Santiago) and the Italian Project Cosmic Rays in the
Heliosphere (IFSI/CNR - Rome). Immediately, the agreement was submitted to the
INACH (Instituto Antartico Chileno) and to the PNRA.  The Italy/Chile
collaboration is made in the frame of the International Decade for Scientific
Cupertino in Antarctica (1991-2000).

The main objective for the LARC project is the study of the cosmic-ray
radiation in the high-latitude southern Latin-American sector, which is not
covered by the worldwide network of cosmic-ray detectors. A standard super
neutron monitor (6-NM-64 type - IQSY detector) is operating on King George
Island (South Shetland Island - Fildes Bay - Ardley Cove) since January 19,
1991. The place is the seat of the E. Frei Base and the Tte. Marsh airport with
Las Estrellas Village and a Meteorological Center.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Fast Longwave And SHortwave Radiative Fluxes (FLASHFlux) project
is based upon the algorithms developed for and data collected by the
Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) project. CERES
is currently producing world-class climate data products derived from
measurements taken aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecrafts. While of
exceptional fidelity, these data products require a considerable
amount of processing to assure quality and verify accuracy and
precision. The result is that CERES data are typically released more
than six months after acquisition of the initial measurements. For
climate studies, such delays are of little consequence especially
considering the improved quality of the released data products.

The FLASHFlux project was envisioned as a conduit whereby CERES data
could be provided to the community within a week of the initial
measurements, with the trade-off that some degree of fidelity would be
exacted to gain speed.

This study is an extension of the numerical modeling circulation
component of the Santa Barbara Channel-Santa Maria Basin
(SBC-SMB) Circulation Study. The SBC-SMB Circulation Study is
the title of the Cooperative Agreement (CA) between the state of
California and the MMS. Absence of sufficient observations, as
has been the case in past modeling programs, prevents proper
model skill assessment. One of the Scientific Review Panel?s
April 1997 recommendations states that successful SBC-SMB model
development, successful analysis of observations, and successful
field work is contingent on all three being performed
concurrently during the conduct of the SBC-SMB Circulation
study. This will allow modelers valuable interaction with the
Study?s principal investigators (PI) (observationalists) during
the conduct of their respective study components.  Recent
numerically modeled simulations of circulation processes
characteristic to the SBC have been, and continue to be, used in
the analysis of observations obtained in that area. Modeled
simulations of the characteristic flows of the SBC and SMB
appropriate for OSRA, and modeled circulation processes helpful
to analysis of the data obtained in the SMB, are not scheduled
for completion under the present contract.

Objectives:

1. Support analysis of observations obtained from the extended
field work with numerically modeled process studies presently
taking place in the Santa Maria Basin.

2. Provide reliable predicted ocean current information for the
Santa Barbara Channel and the SMB by complementing the entire
suite of observations obtained in the SBC-SMB Circulation Study.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The goal of the proposed project is to develop a publicly available electronic informational system, which will be filled with ethnodemographic and genealogical data from variety of sources pertaining to the Saami, Nenets, Enets, Selkup, Nganasan, Teleut, Kumandin, Uilta, Shor and several other peoples of Siberia and the Russian North. This data will cover the period from the 16/17th c. to the present. The system will consist of a database coupled with a web-based interface performing the task of interaction with specially developed server-side modules, which pass queries to the database, and receive and present results to the user. The typical queries, which will require special modules, will be for instance, search for descendants or antecedents of a given person; or grouping of persons according to some criteria, such as given type of sanguineous marriage, economic specialisation, principles ruling the formation of households, etc.
The proposed system does not include any special client-side applications, since the information exchange with users will involve only already existing programmes. The result of a query will be presented to the user in one of the following standard formats at his/her option:
1. ordinary, browser-independent web-page (HTML);
2. CSV file, which is suitable for import into any spreadsheet application (MS Excel, OpenOffice.org Calc, etc.), or into specialised statistical packages (e.g. SPSS), as well as for transfer of data into another database system;
3. GEDCOM, a standard format for exchange of genealogical data, suitable for use with such products as GenoPro for creation of visual representations and printing of genealogical data, and for processing with tools designed network analysis, e.g. Pajek or PGRAPH.
The participants of the project have already gathered considerable amount of personal demographic data pertaining to different peoples, territories and periods of time. We chose to use as model the data arrays on the Saami, Yugan Khanty, Mansi, several groups of Samoyed and Sayan-Altai Turkic peoples, and Uilta. Therefore, the already available materials pertain to the ethnic groups, which significantly vary in their economy, social organisation and history. The collected data originates from all types of historical and contemporary sources that are needed for development of the proposed information system. These arrays of data, being collected in different regions, not always cover the same periods of time. There are also chronological lacunae in some arrays due to the time framework of previous research programmes. Therefore, those lacunae will be filled with the results of field and archival research within the framework of this project.

Project URL: http://www.polenet.org/
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=185

The science programme of the POLENET consortium will investigate polar geodynamics, the earth's magnetic field, crust, mantle and core structure and dynamics, and systems-scale interactions of the solid earth, the cryosphere, the oceans and the atmosphere. Activities will be focused on deployment of autonomous observatories at remote sites on the continents and offshore, coordinated with measurements made at permanent station observatories and by satellite campaigns. Measurements (in situ, satellite and airborne) will include GPS (w/ GLONASS, Galileo; GPS occultation/meteorological sensors), seismic, gravity (absolute and relative), geomagnetic, tide gauges (at coastal sites, or as ocean bottom sensors), and oceanographic (in situ and altimetry) and chemical (at offshore sites). Many sites will be augmented by meteorological sensors. Multidisciplinary deep sea observatories on the polar seafloor will perform continuous collection of geophysical, oceanographic and geochemical data. This initiative will overcome the scarcity of observational systems in the Earth's polar regions, and will provide a legacy in observational infrastructure and the technological capability to overcome the challenges of autonomous operations in extreme environments. 

Geodetic studies, including GPS measurements of crustal motion, tide-gauge measurements of relative sea-level change, and gravity measurements of mass change, constitute essential elements in developing an understanding of the stability and mass balance of the cryosphere and of ongoing sea-level change. There is a critical need to understand the contribution to sea-level change due to changes in mass balance of the major ice sheets of the world, most importantly the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Accurate measurement of millimeter-scale vertical and horizontal crustal motions is possible in only 2-5 years if continuous GPS trackers are deployed. Deployment of C-GPS stations at sufficiently high spatial resolution, and co-located GPS and absolute gravity measurements, will allow discrimination of the elastic response to modern mass change from the secular viscoelastic response to ancient ice mass change. Present-day rebound models are least well constrained in the polar regions and a bi-polar effort during IPY will reduce uncertainty levels and allow more reliable ice history models to be constructed. Together with satellite-based measurement of ice volume and mass change (ICESat, GRACE, GFO, ENVISAT, CRYOSAT), we can use these data to provide robust constraints on ice models and earth models, improving our ability to quantify ice mass loss/gain and sea-level change. Deployment of C-GPS stations across tectonic blocks and boundaries allows crustal motions due to global plate motion and intraplate neotectonic deformation to be measured and velocity fields to be mapped and modeled.

Seismological data from the observatories will provide the first relatively high-resolution data on the Earth beneath the polar seas and ice sheets. Advanced techniques to image the Earths deep interior, such as seismic tomography, will be used to place constraints on the planets internal processes. Seismic imaging of the crust and mantle will assess causes for anomalously high elevations in East Antarctica, linked with ice sheet development, will provide information on heat flow and mantle viscosity that are key factors controlling ice sheet dynamics and the Earth's response to ice mass change, and will provide constraints on the magma sources for polar volcanism. Enhanced seismic station coverage will vastly improve the detection level for earthquakes and permit evaluation of seismotectonic activity and associated seismic hazard across the remote high latitudes. The axial vantage points of the poles will allow unprecedented studies of Earth's inner core, contributing to our understanding of the initial differentiation of the Earth, the Earth's thermal history, and the physics and variability of the Earth's magnetic field.

Project Description:
 The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), operating since 1983, follows the Deep Sea
 Drilling Project (DSDP) which operated from 1968 to 1985. The ODP is (as was
 the DSDP) sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation and several
 foreign countries as a comprehensive investigation of the global oceans. The
 results of the two programs are a large mass of digital data as well as 96
 published DSDP 'Initial Reports' volumes, and to date 19 ODP 'Initial
 Reports' and 3 ODP 'Scientific Results' volumes. In addition, many of the
 data collected by ODP are available on microfilm or microfiche. The digital
 data were compiled from shipboard analyses, onshore laboratory analyses, and
 in some cases, from the INitial Reports and Scientific Results volumes. The
 ODP maintains 26 data bases from the DSDP and over 30 data bases from ODP
 which contain descriptions and/or analyses of marine sediments and rocks
 from Legs 1-96 of DSDP and Legs 101-present (currently completing Leg 128)
 from ODP. The DSDP data were from the cores collected by the drilling bessel
 Glomar Challenger and the ODP data are from cores gathered by the drilling
vessel JOIDES Resolution.
Data used and produced:
 Data types include age profiles of the holes, carbon and carbonate
 percentages of sediments, density/porosity, grain size, G.R.A.P.E.
 (Gamma-Ray attenuations porosity evaluator) data, chemistry of hardrocks
 including major and minor element percentages, thin section and visual hand
 specimen descriptions of hard rock samples, paleomagnetism of both sediments
 and hard rocks in several forms, paleontology for 21 separate fossil groups
 including foraminifera, radiolara, diatoms, nannofossils, etc., penetrometer
 data, site summary information, smearslide descriptions, sonic velocity,
 vane shear measurements, visual core descriptions, x-ray mineralogy, and a
 derived sediment description file called SCREEN with computerized
 standardized sediment descriptions (for DSDP data only).  Auxiliary data
 include various computerized bibliographies and indexes.  Digital
 geophysical data including underway measurements and downhole logs are
 described in other entries.
 Customized data searched can be performed from one dataset or from many
 datasets.  Data are currently available on hard copy (paper) printouts, on
 magnetic tape, through the BITNET network (the ODP Database Group BITNET
 address is %DATABASE@TAMODP), or on IBM or Macintosh formatted diskettes.
 Earlier DSDP data are also available on various media (including CD-ROM)
 from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Land Cover Information for the Baltic Sea Drainage Basin
(BALANS) developed a seamless, homogeneous land cover database
for the Baltic Sea Drainage Basin, based upon medium-resolution
satellite data. "Medium resolution" satellites provide
appropriate datasets for mapping very large areas. Their
multispectral (i.e. colour) images each cover from 350,000 km2
to over 600,000 km2, and yet show features smaller than 200
metres. By joining several such images together, land cover can
be mapped consistently over huge areas. The satellite-based
approach provides a realistic opportunity to produce land cover
information for the entire Baltic Sea Drainage Basin. Such
spatially and thematically detailed, update-able and
cost-effective data is of interest to many users.

The BALANS database provides a spatial resolution of 150 metres,
and provides land cover information in several general, as well
as in some more detailed classes. Currently, the basic database
has been established and a number of products can be derived to
meet users' specific needs for given geographical areas, data
formats (raster or vector), spatial resolution/scale, and
classification schemes. A generalised version of the database is
freely available, including the land cover classes Artificial
surfaces, Forest, Water, Wetlands, Snow/ice and other open
land. The minimum mapping unit is 10 hectares for water and 25
hectares for the remaining classes. This demonstration database
can be downloaded from the page "Download demo data", accessible
via the listbox in the upper right corner.

The original database has more detailed classes and a minimum
mapping unit of 150x150 metres. To buy this high-resolution
version, please turn to "Contact expert" via the listbox and
send us an E-mail from there.

The BALANS project was selected for financing by the European
Commission within the 4th Framework Programme. The 2.5 year
project finished in August 2001.  The project team was led by
Metria Milj?analys, in collaboration with Finnish Environment
Institute, Novosat Oy, GRID-Arendal, GRID-Warsaw and Swedish
Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Developed as part of the Census of Marine Life, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System, or OBIS, is world's largest on-line, database to explain the diversity, distribution and abundance of life in the ocean, past, present and future. In June 2009, OBIS has been adopted by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and continues its operations under IOC's International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) programme.
      
      OBIS is a web-based provider of global geo-referenced information on marine
      species. We contain expert species level and habitat level databases and
      provide a variety of spatial query tools for visualizing relationships among
      species and their environment. OBIS strives to assess and integrate biological,
      physical, and chemical oceanographic data from multiple sources. Users of OBIS,
      including researchers, students, and environmental managers, will gain a
      dynamic view of the multi-dimensional oceanic world. You can explore this
      constantly expanding and developing facility through the OBIS Portal.
      
      The OBIS Portal accesses data content, information infrastructure, and
      informatics tools - maps, visualizations, and models - to provide a dynamic,
      global facility in four dimensions (the three dimensions of space plus time).
      Potential uses are to reveal new spatial/temporal patterns; to generate new
      hypotheses about the global marine ecosystem; and to guide future field
      expeditions. The scope of OBIS offers new challenges in data management,
      scientific cooperation and organization, and innovative approaches to data
      analysis. Maintaining the principle of open access, the digital atlas developed
      by OBIS is expected to provide a fundamental basis for societal and
      governmental decisions on how to harvest and conserve marine life.

The Finnish Antarctic Research Program operates within the Institute of Marine
Research. Its aim is to support the practical implementation of Antarctic
research projects that are funded by the Academy of Finland or other sources
such as research institutes.  

The fieldwork in the Antarctic is usually carried out in the Finnish research
centre Aboa and from there to other areas in the western Queen Maud Land. If
needed, FINNARP arranges working facilities in the research stations of other
countries as well. For marine scientific projects FINNARP arranges
transportation and working facilities on ships.

FINNARP_95-96 includes projects carried out by the program between 1995-1996.  
Southern Ocean research was conducted onboard the research vessel, R/V Aranda.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ClimProb is a java based climate analysis application which has a variety of
tools available to view and examine weather related data sets. Users define a
time period from a choice of over 800 stations located throughout the United
States. Once the user has chosen a state and station to analyze, the time
period of interest is defined. The user then selects a type ... of analyses to be performed: temperature, precipitation, or degree days. From the user specified information, Climprob produces a table with the left side showing a
chronological series of values and the right side showing a probability
distribution of the data. The bottom of the tables also show the mean value of
the data, the standard deviation, the slope, and the intercept of the data.
Once a table of data has been generated, ClimProb can graphically display the
data. Data can be displayed in three types of graphs at the users discretion:
a time series, a probability distribution, or a histogram.

The web site also includes links to a variety of classroom lessons that
incorporate the use of ClimProb. The lessons were developed by K-16 teachers
and have been partitioned into elementary, middle, and college-level
activities.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) was established in
January 1996 by five co-sponsoring organizations. Together with
similar global observing systems for climate (GCOS) and the oceans
(GOOS), GTOS has been created in response to international calls for a
deeper understanding of global change in the Earth System.
The central mission of GTOS is to provide data for detecting,
quantifying, locating and giving early warning of changes in the
capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to sustain development and
improvements in human welfare. GTOS will help find answers to five key
questions:

1. What are the impacts of land use change and degradation on
sustainable development? Can the land produce enough food for the
world's future population (projected at 12,000 million by 2050)?

2. Where, when and by how much will demand for freshwater exceed
supply?

3. Where and when will toxic pollutants cause major threats to human
and environmental health and the capacity of ecosystems to detoxify
them?

4. Where and what type of biological resources are being lost, and
will these losses irreversibly damage ecosystems or human progress?

5. What are the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems?
The core of GTOS will be a permanent observing system for the world's
key managed and natural ecosystems. The system is based on a five-tier
data sampling strategy involving large-scale studies of the Earth's
major environmental gradients, agricultural and ecological research
centres, field stations and a gridded series of some 10,000 sampling
sites.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snowpack Interactions affecting Atmospheric Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in the Arctic</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">OASIS is an international multi-disciplinary effort to study Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snowpack Interactions in the Arctic. The specific focus is to develop a quantitative understanding of the processes that are involved in Air-Surface Interactions and chemical exchange between the title reservoirs. As the nature and extent of snow and ice cover is changing, OASIS will assess the associated impact on, and by, climate change, and the human and ecosystem impacts of air-surface exchanges of chemical species.
OASIS will quantify the impact of chemical, physical and biological exchange processes on tropospheric chemistry, the cryosphere, and the marine environment, and their feedback mechanisms in the context of a changing climate. OASIS has identified studies in the Arctic Ocean surface environment as a key programmatic component to reach these goals. IPY represents a unique opportunity to develop new initiatives that enable the community to do the best science, made possible by an international approach to logistics and experimentation. A legacy will be development and evaluation of new tools, implemented through a network of complex logistics, e.g. involving icebreakers, ice camps, piloted and unmanned vehicles in the atmosphere and ocean, satellite remote sensing, and computer models, to address the pressing scientific issues.
The OASIS program was established in 2003, and has developed an internationally vetted Science Plan, and an Implementation Plan, available at www.OASISHome.net. A growing number of individual projects are contributing to the scientific goals since winter 2004/05 (to date 45 individual projects, see 3.11 below). OASIS is linked to a number of international organizations and activities, including AMAP (the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program), and the IGBP (International Geosphere – Biosphere) programs IGAC (International Global Atmospheric Chemistry) under the AICI (Air Ice Chemical Interactions) activity, and SOLAS (Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study).
During IPY (2007 – 2009), we propose to:
1. Conduct coordinated icebreaker, ice camp, and aircraft studies of OASIS chemical exchange. A principal focus will be a nine-month coordinated campaign from the frozen-in icebreaker ‘m/v Antarctica’ and connected ice camps. Measurements will be made of a wide variety of chemical and biological compounds and physical properties in the Arctic marine boundary layer atmosphere, cryosphere and ocean. The impact on, and by, the physical state of the local environment will be a key topic of these studies. Shorter ice breaker campaigns (e.g. involving the Canadian “Amundsen” and the Russian ice-enforced RV "Akademik Feodorov",and "Mikhail Somov”) are also envisaged. This and connected aircraft work will be coordinated with other international IPY efforts.
2. Establish a network of Arctic Ocean buoys that will enable year-round measurements of ozone and related chemical species. This work will fill major gaps in our knowledge of physical/chemical variables involved with Arctic Ocean surface ozone and mercury depletion and radiatively-active trace-gas budgets. The network will evolve in close cooperation with the International Arctic Buoy Project, the North Pole Environmental Observatory, and the proposed Arctic Ocean Observing System.
3. Examine physical and chemical oceanographic variables that influence ocean-atmosphere chemical exchange, by observations of parameters in physical oceanography; marine biology; marine geology; sea ice characteristics; and hydrography using, among other tools, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as Below ice Environmental Laboratory.
In addition, not directly related to IPY, OASIS will:
4. Conduct supporting laboratory studies of biological, chemical and physical processes relevant to snow, ice, gas, and aerosol phase photochemistry and chemical exchange.
5. Develop and apply 1D and 3D models of OASIS exchange and associated atmospheric chemistry and cloud physics impacts, in association with scientists involved with 1-3 above.

Stardust is the first U.S. space mission dedicated solely to the
exploration of a comet, and the first robotic mission designed
to return extraterrestrial material from outside the orbit of
the Moon.

The Stardust spacecraft was launched on February 7, 1999, from
Cape Canaveral Air Station, Florida, aboard a Delta II
rocket. The primary goal of Stardust is to collect dust and
carbon-based samples during its closest encounter with Comet
Wild 2 - pronounced "Vilt 2" after the name of its Swiss
discoverer - is a rendezvous scheduled to take place in January
2004, after nearly four years of space travel.

Additionally, the Stardust spacecraft will bring back samples of
interstellar dust, including recently discovered dust streaming
into our Solar System from the direction of Sagittarius. These
materials are believed to consist of ancient pre-solar
interstellar grains and nebular that include remnants from the
formation of the Solar System. Analysis of such fascinating
celestial specks is expected to yield important insights into
the evolution of the Sun its planets and possibly even the
origin of life itself.

In order to meet up with comet Wild 2, the spacecraft will make
three loops around the Sun. On the second loop, its trajectory
will intersect the comet. During the meeting, Stardust will
perform a variety of tasks including reporting counts of comet
particles encountered by the spacecraft with the Dust Flux
Monitor, and real-time analyses of the compositions of these
particles and volatiles taken by the Comet and Interstellar Dust
Analyzer (CIDA). Using a substance called aerogel, Stardust will
capture these samples and store them for safe keep on its long
journey back to Earth. This silica-based, material has been
inserted within the Aerogel Collector Grid, which is similar to
a large tennis racket. Not until January 2006, will Stardust and
its precise cargo return by parachuting a reentry capsule
weighing approximately 125 pounds to the Earth's surface.

Stardust is the fourth NASA Discovery mission to be chosen and
follows on the heels of Mars Pathfinder, the Near Earth Asteroid
Rendezvous (NEAR) mission, and the Lunar Prospector
mission. Discovery is an ongoing program that is intended to
offer the scientific community opportunities to accomplish
frequent, high quality scientific investigations using
innovative and efficient management approaches. It seeks to keep
performance high and expenses low by using new technologies and
strict cost caps.

The Stardust Mission is a collaborative effort between NASA,
university and industry partners:

The Principal Investigator is Dr. Donald E. Brownlee of the
University of Washington, well known for his discovery of cosmic
particles in the stratosphere known as Brownlee Particles. He
also co-authored the bestseller Rare Earth : Why Complex Life Is
Uncommon, which puts forward a hypothesis predicting that
simple, microbial life will be widespread in the universe, while
complex animal or plant life will be extremely rare.

Dr. Peter Tsou of the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), innovator in
aerogel technology serves as Deputy Investigator.

The contractor for the Stardust spacecraft is Lockheed Martin
Astronautics, Denver, Colorado.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has an experienced project
management team, led by Thomas C. Duxbury. In addition, JPL
provided the optical navigation camera.

The Max Planck Institute (MPI) of Germany provided the real-time
dust composition analyzer for the spacecraft.

Ames Research Center provided the heat shield.

Johnson Space Center will provide the planetary materials
curatorial facility where the samples can be preserved and tests
conducted.

University of Chicago provided the Navigation Camera.

The purposes of the project are to employ existing and new data and information to describe and analyse,
i) onshore and offshore mineral and biological resources in the Norwegian and Russian Arctic from northern Norway and the Kola Peninsula in the west to the Bering Strait in the east,
ii) existing and planned economic and commercial activities based on the resources,
iii) environmental, infrastructural, economic, social, and institutional factors and conditions of importance to the exploitation of the resources and to particular types of business and investment opportunities, and
iv) within a paradigm of sustainable development, create plausible scenarios of social, economic, and commercial trends over the next 10-20 and 20-40 years. 

The overall aim is to, 
produce a source of data, information, and analyses about the natural resources of the northern and Arctic parts of Norway and Russia that is unique and will be judged to be the obvious first choice of consultation for investment information and opportunities by state and private companies and organizations in Norway, Russia, and elsewhere. 

The project has five sections. 
Section 1 will consist of the most comprehensive description of mineral and biological resources and activites based on them so far undertaken.
Section 2 will give an exhaustive account of infrastruture, especially transportation, communication, and logistical factors.
Section 3 will concentrate on environmental factors, challenges, and conditions adverse or conducive to sustainable exploitation of the natural resources.
Section 4 will describe and analyse economic, social, legal, and institutional factors that in various ways will affect the viability of economic and commercial activities.
Section 5 will build on and draw together the results of the previous sections to make scenarios of sustainable development in the regions over the next 10-20 and 20-40 years. 

The implementation of the project will proceed in two phases. The first will cover northern and Arctic Norway and northwest Russia, defined as the Murmansk Oblast, the Republic of Karelia, the Arkhangelsk Oblast, the Republic of Komi, the Nenets Autonomous Akrug, and the Barents, White, Pechora, and Kara Seas. This phase will last from May 2006 to April 2008.
The second phase, covering the Russian Arctic from the Urals to the Bering Strait, will commence immediately upon the completion of the first phase and will last another two years. 

Northwards the area covered by the project has a natural limit given by the summer time sea-ice edge, including the Northern Sea Route to the Bering Strait. Onshore the project will cover areas to the south where resources are recoverable and accessible by reasonable means of transport. This will include areas along some of the major waterways and rivers in both countries.

If a similar trend for states West Antarctica with the disappearance of 'ice shelves', thinning and acceleration of certain concomitant large outlet glaciers (eg Pine Island Glacier, Rignot, 1998), role of East Antarctica, although potentially more threatening in terms of sea level is still poorly defined. The work proposed here intends to measure and model the present and future development of the area that is the workshop of the Astrolabe glacier (logistic facilities) as well as large outlet glaciers more distant (Ninnis, Mertz, Dibble, Terre Adélie sector - George V Land) which by their size, drain a significant portion of the East Antarctic ice cap (annual flows of ice in the order of several tens of km 3 per year).

The BIOTAS Programme was established in the late 1980's to coordinate
terrestrial, limnological and littoral biological and related
environmental research in the Antarctic. BIOTAS is a body of
interacting scientists with common interests and goals who exchange
ideas and information to ensure awareness of current and proposed
research. This is to help maximise the value of their own research and
to minimise the duplication of effort and the wasting of resources.

The objectives of BIOTAS include the encouragement of collaboration
and, where desirable, replication of research studies using
standardised procedures. Also, to encourage research studies to follow
a more unified approach, so that national programmes may complement
each other and permit a more valid comparison of data between
localities and systems. To facilitate this, BIOTAS has produced a
manual of methods to aid standardisation and inter-comparability
(Wynn-Williams, 1992). As yet, there is no computer network linking
members of BIOTAS. However, the Microbial Strain Data Network is
already used by the British Antarctic Survey to hold data on microbial
cultures and its use may well be extended to include other data sets
of relevance to BIOTAS.

In a world experiencing climate global changes, loss of biodiversity and depletion of fisheries, the biotas of the Antarctic and the Sub-Antarctic offer compelling natural laboratories for understanding the evolutionary impact of these processes. Since the IGY (1957-58), biologists have made impressive progress in understanding the Antarctic ichthyofauna. However, research integration into the broader marine context has been limited, largely due to lack of access to Sub-Antarctic fishes. These fishes, in particular those of the dominant suborder Notothenioidei, are critical for a complete understanding of the evolution, population dynamics, eco-physiology and eco-biochemistry of their Antarctic relatives. 

The ICEFISH programme is designed to fill these critical gaps in our knowledge. Cruises, encompassing the South Atlantic, South Pacific and South Indian Ocean sectors constitute the ICEFISH programme, the first comprehensive international survey of the Sub-Antarctic marine habitat. The first, ICEFISH-2004 (17 May -17 July 2004) was a resounding success. Extensive fishing was performed in the South Atlantic sector: Burwood Banks, Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas, Shag Rock, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, Bouvetoya, and Tristan de Cunha, at depths ranging from tidepools to the abyss (for information on the cruise, participants, and detailed science projects, see www.icefish.neu.edu). 

Although autonomous, ICEFISH-2007 builds on the important legacy of ICEFISH-2004. It will sample the Sub-Antarctic Pacific sector, including Campbell and Scott Islands, Antipodes, Auckland, Macquarie, and Balleny Islands. Fishing will be multi-modal, using Otter, mid-water, Blake and MOCNESS trawls, plankton nets, beach seining, tide pooling, and traps. We will charter a suitable ice-strengthened ship/icebreaker, equipped with aquaria with running seawater to maintain live specimens, and with high-quality research laboratories. Twenty-four to 28 scientists will participate, largely those of the 2004 cruise, ensuring continuity of the scientific focus of the ICEFISH programme. The scientific activity will cover a wide range of topics, many of which will develop work carried out in ICEFISH-2004. We will summarise some of these topics: 

- Systematics and evolutionary studies to relate Sub-Antarctic notothenioids to their Antarctic relatives through morphological, molecular and cytological analyses. The diversity of habitats and attendant species likely to be collected in ICEFISH 2007 clearly warrant such a comparative analysis, which will shed light on evolutionary diversity and radiative capacity within this sub-order. 

- Life history strategies and population dynamics to characterise the composition, distribution, habitat preferences and diets of the Sub-Antarctic species, and larval recruitment.

- Diversity and biogeography. Documentation of fish biodiversity and possible discovery and description of unknown species, for example in the vicinity of the Balleny Islands and Scott Island (CCAMLR Statistical Subarea 88.1), where the fish fauna is poorly known. As transition zones between the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic notothenioid faunas, these islands are key to recognizing and understanding latitudinal gradients in faunal composition in the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean. Liparids of the Southern Hemisphere are important from an evolutionary and zoogeographic perspective; many of these species are known only from one or two specimens. In addition, new species are still being found frequently. ICEFISH-2007 would be an important opportunity to sample previously poorly sampled regions to add to knowledge of the distribution and evolution of the family. Collection at depths below 1000 m is desirable.

- Physiological, biochemical and molecular-biological studies of organ and tissue systems to analyse the evolutionary basis of the adaptations of high-Antarctic nototothenioids relative to their ancestral stock.

- Genomic resources for Sub-Antarctic notothenioids (nucleic-acid libraries for comparative studies of the genomes of high- and low-latitude species). Because of the causal linkage between the thermal histories of marine environment, and the waxing and waning of the antifreeze trait, the extent of the antifreeze genotypic and functional capacity in related notothenioids within and outside of the high-Antarctic is an excellent biological indicator of regional variations or changes in thermal environments in the Southern Ocean. Spleen and testis tissues will be frozen for future preparation of DNA and RNA that will be used to evaluate the antifreeze glycoprotein genotype, Erythrocytes from red-blooded species and white blood cells from icefishes will be embedded in agarose plugs and used to prepare high molecular weight DNA for the construction of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries. The BAC libraries will permit the global analysis of genome evolution of the notothenioids driven by thermal challenges.

Programme Description:
----------------------
ARTEMIS (Africa Real Time Environmental Monitoring Using Imaging Satellites) is
an operational environmental monitoring program of the United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organisation.  It provides real and near-real time precipitation
and vegetation assessment for Africa, the Near East and southwest Asia based on
the integrated use of high frequency Meteosat and NOAA AVHRR data.  ARTEMIS was
designed and implemented for FAO by the National Aerospace Laboratory of the
Netherlands, in co-operation with Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA) and the
British Universities of Bristol and Reading.  ARTEMIS became operational (at
the FAO Remote Sensing Centre, Rome) during August 1988.
ARTEMIS was developed to improve the supply of information on growing
conditions for the FAO Global Information and Early Warning System
(GIEWS) and Emergency Centre for Locust Operations (ECLO).  However,
ARTEMIS data are now, more and more, provided to users involved in
early warning for food security and desert locust control at the
regional and national levels in Africa.  The ARTEMIS products are
distributed to its users on colour hardcopies, IBM-PC compatible
diskettes, tapes and as point-listing using mail, pouch and courier
services.  In addition, FAO and the European Space Agency (ESA) are
collaborating to develop a dedicated satellite communications system,
DIANA (Data and Information Available Now in Africa), which will
enable high speed digital dissemination of ARTEMIS products, and other
information, to remote stations in Africa.
Databases and Products:
-----------------------
ARTEMIS uses the following reference databases:
1. Geographic -
   CIA World Database I (coastlines, country boundaries and major rivers);
2. Agroclimatological -
   mean annual/mean monthly rainfall, and 10-day potential evapotranspiration
   (PET) for Africa (based on published FAO agroclimatological records);
3. Desert Locust Habitat -
   5-class ranking of potential desert locust habitats in the recession area of
   West Africa (in preparation, based on unpublished data).
ARTEMIS produces the following operational databases:
1. Cold Cloud Duration (operational) -
   10-day and monthly cumulative raincloud duration data for Africa and the
   Near East (derived from hourly Meteosat Primary Data User Station data).
   Produced continuously since the third dekad of August, 1988;
2. Number of Rainfall Days (operational) -
   Total number of raindays during 10-day and monthly periods, for Africa and
   the Near East (derived form Meteosat Primary Data User Station data).
   Produced continuously since the third dekad of August, 1988;
3. Estimated Rainfall (operational) -
   10-day and monthly rainfall (mm) for Africa (Sahelian-Sudanian zone) based
   on a regression between cold cloud duration (derived from Meteosat Primary
   Data User Station data and observed rainfall).  Produced continuously since
   the third dekad of August, 1988;
4. NOAA Vegetation Index (NDVI) (operational) -
   10-day and monthly composite vegetation index data for Africa, the Near East
   and southwest Asia.  Data for Africa available from 1982 onwards.  Historical
   data for other regions are being prepared;
5. Crop Moisture Availability (experimental) -
   Water balance data on 10-day basis for Africa (Sahelian-Sudanian zone) using
   a simple waterbalance method based on 'Estimated Rainfall data', and fixed
   crop coefficient and soil water holding capacity parameters;
6. Monthly Rainfall Anomalies (experimental) -
   Monthly rainfall anomaly data for West Africa obtained through comparison of
   monthly estimated rainfall (i.e. 'Estimated Rainfall' data) with the
   long-term norm (i.e. 'Agroclimatological' data);
7. Potential Breeding Activity Factor (experimental) -
   Desert locust potential breeding activity derived from 'Desert Locust
   Habitat' data and data from the operational NDVI database.
All ARTEMIS products are available in a common geographic projection
(Hammer-Aitoff equal area projection, at a spatial resolution of 7.6 km), in
either photographic or digital format (digital image size roughly 2.6 Mb).

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Global Change - Social Challenges Processes of socio-economic changes in the Circumpolar North, with focus on gender and inter and intra-generational relations.</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">As development in Northern and Arctic communities are influencing both the living conditions and the cultural characteristics of the population in the North, the present pace of globalization is calling for a research focus on both short and long term perspectives in social and socio-economic changes. The question of sustainable development emphasizes the need of understanding changes not only in relation to the present, but in an inter-generational perspective. In addition the need for a gender perspective on the development process has been emphasized.
Crucial is on one hand the need of interdisciplinarity in the research activities, because there is an intimate connections between the bio-physical, the socio-economic and the cultural worlds. And on the other hand, an understanding of the changes in inter-generational and gender perspectives is very much needed. The focus of the project will be on six major components shaping the future social characteristics of the Northern and Arctic communities.
1) Change in resource use, technology and employment patterns. The technologification and capitalization of renewable and non-renewable resources has profound implications on both the sectors and the communities. Similarly the technological development and its influence on the access and distribution of information, insight, knowledge and understanding, contributes to the shaping of the future through increased access by Arctic residents to the global flow of information, as well as access for outsiders to a more in-depth understanding of the Arctic perspectives.
2) Change in values, power relations, perception, preferences and life strategies. The basis is the status of the living conditions, health and welfare situation characterizing the communities in the Arctic. In this process migration has a profound impact on kinship and family, just as on the children´s position in the family and society. Retrospective: Changing patterns of (gendered) social and geographical mobility. In status: Mobility, aspirations and actions: Rationalities and reasoning in relation to patterns of mobility. And Prospective: Youth Aspirations in relation to social and geographical mobility.
3) Change in community dynamics and gender aspects of the development process, where one component is on the status of education and research activities shaping the future patterns of development, especially the question of the interaction between the two divergent processes of centralization and decentralization as components in the process. Similarly components in the ongoing changes include the regional and structural characteristics of different types of settlements such as the divide between towns and villages and the differences in perceptions of development goals.
4) Shift in income patterns, property issues, resource rights, as well as access to decision making. A key question will be women’s access to decision making in the resource based sectors in rural areas of the north.
5) The questions of risk, threads and crises in the development process, and how realities as well as the perceptions are influencing the social interaction in Arctic communities. On one hand the question of establishing and maintaining efficient and competent health system in sparsely populated Arctic regions including the modification and transfer of technology to quite different settings. And on the other hand the question of understanding and managing violence, both in its public and domestic forms.
6) A cross-cutting issue - is the youth and gender perspectives on the development process, on one hand the question of participation and involvement in the social processes, and on the other hand their specific role in the processes of change, influencing both the direction and characteristics of the development process.
A crucial topic for the consortium is the further development of the research school activities within the framework of CASS and CAES, so the list of contributors include as well members of the research consortium as well as members of the research school groups.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and energy balance were made using chamber-, tower-, and aircraft-based measurement techniques in Alaskan arctic tundra ecosystems during the 1994-1995 growing seasons (JuneAugust). One of our objectives was to quantify the interrelationships between the NEE and the energy balance measurements made from different sampling techniques. Qualitative and quantitative intercomparisons revealed that on average the correspondence between the mass and energy fluxes measured by these sampling methods was good despite potential spatial and temporal mismatches in sampling scale. Quantitative comparisons using least squares linear regression analyses with the tower-based measurements of NEE as the independent variable indicate that the chamber- and aircraft-based NEE measurements were generally lower relative to the tower-based measurements (slope=0.760.86). Similarly, tower-aircraft comparisons of latent (Le) and sensible (H) heat exchange indicated that the aircraft-based measurements were lower than the tower-based measurements (slope=0.720.80). Qualitative comparisons, however, indicate that the correspondence among the chamber-, tower-, and aircraft-measured fluxes varied both seasonally and interannually, suggesting the lack of a consistent bias between the sampling techniques. The results suggest that differences observed between the chamber, tower, and aircraft flux measurements were primarily due to the failure to account for the spatial distribution of surface types in the tower and aircraft sampling footprint, problems involved in the comparison of temporal and spatial averages, and temporal (e.g., seasonal and interannual) variance in rates of mass and energy flux for a given point. Other potential sources of variance include the underestimation of nocturnal NEE by the tower-based eddy covariance system, and the periodic occurrence of an elevated CO2 plume in the atmosphere over the Prudhoe Bay oil field. Even with these potential sources of variation, the results reveal that the various methods give comparable estimates of NEE and energy flux within a range of temporal or spatial variability.

The International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO) is the focal point for the planning and implementation of all GEWEX Projects and activities.

The goal of GEWEX is to reproduce and predict, by means of suitable models, the variations of the global hydrological regime, its impact on atmospheric and surface dynamics, and variations in regional hydrological processes and water resources and their response to changes in the environment, such as the increase in greenhouse gases. GEWEX will provide an order of magnitude improvement in the ability to model global precipitation and evaporation, as well as accurate assessment of the sensitivity of atmospheric radiation and clouds to climate change.

IceCube is a one-cubic-kilometer international high-energy neutrino observatory being installed in the ice below the South Pole Station. A companion cosmic ray surface air shower array, IceTop, will complement the detection of high energy astrophysical neutrinos and support IceCube by identifying background events. The IceCube detector will consist of approximately 80 strings of 60 digital optical modules deployed at depths between 1400 and 2400 meters. The IceTop detector will have a pair of frozen water tanks at the ice surface above each IceCube string. Each tank will have two digital optical modules to monitor cosmic ray events. The digital optical modules detect the light produced when charged particles pass through the ice, enabling the IceCube detector to track particles produced by neutrinos and IceTop to reconstruct cosmic ray events. Deployment of the first strings and surface IceTop tanks is underway now and will continue until the detector is completed in the 2009-2010 season. 

IceCube will open unexplored bands for astronomy, including the PeV (1015 eV) energy region, where the Universe is opaque to high energy gamma rays originating from beyond the edge of our own galaxy, and where cosmic rays do not carry directional information because of their deflection by magnetic fields. The instrument may, for example, answer the question of whether the fascinating multi-TeV photons originating in the Crab supernova remnant and near the supermassive black holes of active galaxies are of hadronic or electromagnetic origin. IceCube will provide a totally novel viewpoint on the multi-messenger astronomy of gamma ray bursts, which have been identified as a possible source of the highest energy particles in nature. 

IceCube also occupies a unique place in the multi-prong attack on the particle nature of dark matter, with unmatched sensitivity to cold dark matter particles approaching TeV masses. As a particle physics experiment with the capability to detect neutrinos with energies far beyond those produced at accelerators, IceCube will join the race to discover supersymmetric particles and the topological defects created in grand unified phase transitions in the early universe. The detection of cosmic neutrino beams would open the opportunity to study neutrino oscillations over Megaparsec baselines. 

These exciting capabilities notwithstanding, there should be no doubt the true potential of IceCube is discovery. History has not previously disappointed us: the opening of each new astronomical window has led to unexpected discoveries. Hidden particle accelerators may, for instance, exist from which only the neutrinos escape.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
EPA's Global Change Research Program is an assessment-oriented program
with primary emphasis on understanding the potential consequences of
climate variability and change on human health, ecosystems, and
socioeconomic systems in the United States. This entails: (1)
improving the scientific basis for evaluating effects of global change
in the context of other stressors and human dimensions (as humans are
catalysts of and respond to global change); (2) conducting assessments
of the risks and opportunities presented by global change; and (3)
assessing adaptation options to improve society's ability to
effectively respond to the risks and opportunities presented by global
change as they emerge.

The program has made a major commitment to the National Assessment
activities organized through the USGCRP. The Global Change Research
Act of 1990 mandates that the USGCRP conduct periodic assessments of
the potential consequences of global change for the United
States. (These periodic assessments are to be conducted not less than
every four years.) As a member of the USGCRP, EPA's Global Program
will continue to make significant contributions to the ongoing
U.S. National Assessment Process. The EPA-sponsored assessments will
continue to be conducted through public-private partnerships that
actively engage researchers from the academic community, decision
makers, resource managers, and other affected stakeholders in the
assessment process.

EPA's intramural assessment program has four areas of emphasis: (1)
human health; (2) air quality; (3) water quality; and (4) ecosystem
health. These four focus areas are consistent with EPA's mission and
the strengths of EPA's research program.

The first focus area is Human Health. Since health is affected by a
variety of social, economic, political, environmental, and
technological factors, assessing the health impacts of global change
is a complex challenge. As a result, health assessments in EPA's
Global Program go beyond basic epidemiological research to develop
integrated health assessment frameworks that consider the effects of
multiple stresses, their interactions, and human adaptive
responses. Along with health sector assessments conducted in
conjunction with the USGCRP National Assessment process, there are
research and assessment activities focused on the consequences of
global change on weather-related morbidity and vector- and water-borne
diseases. In addition, the results from the Global Program's air
quality assessments will be used to evaluate health consequences.

The second focus area is Ecosystems. The EPA's mission is not only to
protect human health but also to safeguard the natural
environment. EPA has pledged to provide environmental protection that
"contributes to making communities and ecosystems diverse,
sustainable, and economically productive." Consistent with this goal,
EPA's Global Program is considering comprehensive ecosystem issues
related to global change. Three research and assessment activities are
planned that evaluate the effects of global change on 1) aquatic
ecosystems (which may include lakes, rivers, and streams; wetlands;
and estuaries and coastal ecosystems); 2) invasive non-indigenous
species; and 3) ecosystem services. The assessment of aquatic
ecosystems will contribute to water quality assessments of pollutants
and pathogens and of biocriteria. The ecosystem services assessment
will draw on work from the other ecosystem assessments.

The third focus area is Air Quality. Few studies have investigated the
effect of global change on air quality. Given EPA's legal mandates
with respect to air pollution and substantial capability and expertise
in modeling air quality and evaluating integrated response actions,
examining the effects of global change on air quality is a logical
focus of the Global Program. Assessments are planned that will examine
the potential consequences of global change on tropospheric ozone and
particulate matter. Each of these assessments is paired with a related
human health assessment.

The fourth focus area is Water Quality. Water quality is affected by
changes in runoff following changes in precipitation and
evapotranspiration and/or changes in land use. The program plans two
assessments of the possible impacts of global change (climate and land
use change) on water quality. Both water quality assessments will
either contribute to or benefit from human health and ecosystems
assessments. In addition, results from the assessment of pollutants
and microbial pathogens will be used in the assessment of biocriteria.

GIS of Mexican states, municipalities, and islands, 1990, in Arc/Info
export format. In this dataset, the boundaries of the Mexican
states and municipalites that share borders with the United
States are consistent with those from TIGER95. Attributes
include selected demographic and socioeconomic variables from
INEGI.

Population growth is widely recognized as a key driving force behind
environmental change, especially in developing countries. Improving
understanding of the processes involved in population growth and the
environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with it is
therefore critical. Unfortunately, one barrier to better understanding
has been the lack of detailed subnational data on population
distribution and change and the difficulty of linking such data to
environmental and other datasets that do not conform with
administrative units.

In recognition of this problem, the Center for International Earth
Science Information Network (CIESIN) developed a population data
collection for Mexico, drawing on a unique set of georeferenced
population data and on Geographic Information System (GIS)
technology. Mexico is of particular interest because of its rapid
population growth and urbanization, diverse levels of development,
growing environmental problems, and potential vulnerability to global
environmental change.

The Georeferenced Population Data Sets of Mexico consists of the
following products: Population Database of Mexico; Urban Place,
Time-Series Population Spreadsheet of Mexico; Urban Place GIS Coverage
of Mexico; GIS Coverage of Mexican Localities; GIS Coverage of Mexican
States; GIS Coverage of Mexican Municipalities; and Raster Based GIS
Coverage of Mexican Population.

Included in the collection are approximately 100,000 records of
geographic and census items for Mexican states, municipalities, and
localities. The geographic records consist of state boundaries, place
names, geographic coordinates of more than 30,000 urban and
metropolitan places, and elevation data for more than 700 urban
places. The census records contain estimates of 1990 population
density, population by gender, and population by age bracket (below 6
years of age, between 6 and 14 years, and older than 15 years). For
706 selected urban localities, the population is traced back by
decades, from 1990 to 1921, based on census documents.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">A Broad-Scale Global Array of Temperature/Salinity Profiling Floats</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
ARGO is a broad-scale global array of temperature/salinity profiling
floats, known as Argo, is planned as a major component of the ocean
observing system. Deployment began in 2000.  Conceptually, Argo builds
on the existing upper-ocean thermal networks, extending their spatial
and temporal coverage, depth range and accuracy, and enhancing them
through addition of salinity and velocity measurements.  The name Argo
is chosen to emphasize the strong complementary relationship of the
global float array with the Jason altimeter mission.  For the first
time, the physical state of the upper ocean will be systematically
measured and assimilated in near real-time.

Objectives of Argo fall into several categories.  Argo will provide a
quantitative description of the evolving state of the upper ocean and
the patterns of ocean climate variability, including heat and
freshwater storage and transport.  The data will enhance the value of
the Jason altimeter through measurement of subsurface vertical
structure (T(z), S(z)) and reference velocity, with sufficient
coverage and resolution for interpretation of altimetric sea surface
height variability.  Argo data will be used for initialization of
ocean and coupled forecast models, data assimilation and dynamical
model testing.  A primary focus of Argo is seasonal to decadal climate
variability and predictability, but a wide range of applications for
high-quality global ocean analyses is anticipated.

The initial design of the Argo network is based on experience from the
present observing system, on newly gained knowledge of variability
from the TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter, and on estimated requirements for
climate and high-resolution ocean models.  Argo will provide 100,000
T/S profiles and reference velocity measurements per year from about
3000 floats distributed over the global oceans at 3-degree spacing.
Floats will cycle to 2000 m depth every 10 days, with a 4-5 year
lifetime for individual instruments.  All Argo data will be publicly
available in near real-time via the GTS, and in scientifically
quality-controlled form with a few months delay.  Global coverage
should be achieved during the Global Ocean Data Assimilation
Experiment, which together with CLIVAR and GCOS/GOOS, provide the
major scientific and operational impetus for Argo.  The design
emphasizes the need to integrate Argo within the overall framework of
the global ocean observing system.

International planning for Argo, including sampling and technical
issues, is coordinated by the Argo Science Team.  Nations presently
having Argo plans that include float procurement or production include
Australia, Canada, France, Japan, U.K., and U.S.A., plus a European
Union proposal.  Combined deployments from these nations are expected
to exceed 700 floats per year by 2002.  Broad participation in Argo by
many nations is anticipated and encouraged either through float
procurement, logistical support for float deployment, or through
analysis and assimilation of Argo data.

The Network for Arctic Climate and Biological Diversity Studies (ARCDIV) is a multidisciplinary research cluster under the International Polar Year (IPY 2007-2008), seeking to explore the diversity of climates and ecosystems at landscape scale within the Arctic region, by integrating historical, existing and new intense measurements of key physical and biological variables and processes at multiple Arctic observational sites.

Rationale: The recently published Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) presents detailed information of the significant contemporary changes in regional variability and trends of climate and ecosystems in the Arctic, with important coupling and feedback mechanisms to the global climate system. The ARCDIV cluster will establish several reference areas in the Arctic, equipped with permanent long-term and new intense campaign based measurements of physical and biological parameters on various temporal and spatial scales, with the aim to resolve the variability of climate and biological diversity on landscape and regional scales around the Arctic. These new observations will be held against data from long-term climate monitoring and experimentally manipulated plots. This is a new frontier for climate change and ecosystem interaction studies aiming at understanding small-scale physical and biological variability in time and space and their links to the large-scale regional climate variability and trend patterns with relation to global climate change.

Scientific Content: Multidisciplinary research groups will set up coordinated and intense atmospheric/terrestrial measurement systems and field observations at the different reference sites, integrating the following scientific themes and activities on the basis of variable geometry:

· Physical observations: Meteorological synoptic and automatic weather stations, micrometeorological measurements, radiosondes, UAV and sodar profiling of the ABL, atmospheric radiation including UV, surface radiation budget, regional spectral albedo on land and sea ice, surface energy balance, snow/ice distribution, hydrology, geochemistry, wetland methane fluxes, arrays of temperature loggers and freeze-thawing events.

· Biological observations: Vegetation monitoring and mapping, cryobiology, alpha/beta and genetic diversity, nutrient and carbon cycling/sequestration, microbial communities in soil and freshwater, trophic interactions and structure, predator-prey systems, herbivory, stress parameters, structure and function of ecosystems and colonization.

· Models/Integration: Physical, atmospheric circulation, landscape and radiation transfer models will be used together with the intense physical observations to describe the local abiotic environmental variability and its relation to the regional atmospheric circulation. GIS-systems will assist sampling and integrated analysis of the physical and biological parameters. Remote sensing will be used for extraction of physical and biological parameters at the reference sites. Multi-scale statistical methods will be used for integrated analysis, including the possible projection of future changes.

-Cluster components: This multidisciplinary initiative cluster a coherent set of EOI's for the purpose of coordinating the many complementary research groups of different disciplines and nationalities that are active at various sites/stations in the Arctic, studying different aspects of climate and biological diversity. The added value for all partners is to get access to data relevant for own studies and the total integration of physical and biological knowledge in order to address the complex interaction mechanisms between abiotic and biotic parameters involving small and regional scales.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Aerosol Characterization Experiments (ACE) are designed to increase our understanding of how atmospheric aerosol particles affect the Earth's climate system. ACE-Asia was the fourth in this series of experiments organized by the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Program (A Core Project of the International Geosphere Biosphere Program).  

ACE-Asia took place during the spring of 2001 (schedule) off the coast of China, Japan and Korea (map). The ACE-Asia region includes many types of aerosol particles of widely varying composition and size derived from one of the largest aerosol source regions on Earth. These particles include those emitted by human activities and industrial sources, as well as wind-blown dust. Results from ACE-Asia have improved our understanding of how atmospheric aerosols influence the chemical and radiative properties of the Earths atmosphere. Specifically:  

The dust we can observe by satellite, transported half way around the globe, is not just dust, it is dust mixed with pollution. Air pollution changes dust aerosols in many ways, adding black carbon, toxic materials, and acidic gases to the mineral particles. Atmospheric chemistry and its impact on air quality and climate change are truly global issues. 
  
We can not measure dust in one region and assume that dust everywhere around the Earth has the same impact on climate. The dust that is transported from East Asia to the Pacific does not absorb as much light as the dark aerosol from South Asia or some previous measurements of dust from the Sahara Desert. There are dramatic regional differences in the chemical and optical properties of aerosols. 
  
Combining ACE-Asia suborbital and satellite measurements yields monthly average (April 2001) cloud-free aerosol radiative forcing at the surface exceeding -30 W m-2 in a plume covering the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan and region downwind of Japan.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A project documenting patterns of biodiversity and related processes in the Gulf of Maine, which will be used to establish ecosystem-based management of the area.

The Gulf of Maine Census of Marine Life is one of seven initial field projects of the Census of Marine Life (CoML). The Gulf of Maine was selected as the ecosystem pilot study for CoML. The goal of this program is to gain enough knowledge to enable ecosystem-based management in a large marine environment. The program will advance knowledge of both biodiversity and ecological processes over a range of habitats and food-chain levels, from plankton to whales.

Missing Links
The Gulf of Maine is a dynamic ecosystem. Both natural and human influences have wrought large changes in the abundance and diversity of life in its waters. Such species as mackerel, herring, and lobster have flourished at times, but wild Atlantic salmon are endangered, and traditional livelihoods have been wiped out by the collapse of such bottom-dwelling fish as haddock and cod. We know a lot about some individual species, but we don't know enough about these populations, their habitats, and their interactions with one another and their environment to determine why these changes have taken place or what the future may hold.

Scientific Objectives
This program will focus on marine life in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank and adjacent Slope Sea, and the New England Seamounts. The team will take advantage of and demonstrate the latest technologies to perform an integrated study aimed at understanding both the biogeography of the gulf and the processes controlling it. A broad suite of instruments and sensors will collect data on the physical and biological characteristics of the Gulf of Maine. Scientists will use both traditional and new collection devices for physical capture of the Gulf's inhabitants. Acoustical and optical devices will be deployed or operated from surface vessels, towed sleds, and remotely operated and autonomous vehicles.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Ice and snow mass change of Arctic and Antarctic polar regions using GRACE satellite gravimetry</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The main objective of the proposed work is the study space and time mass variations of ice mad snow over polar regions, the estimation of the water mass balance using monthly GRACE geoids for the recent period, as well as its connection with global climate change, the global hydrological cycle, and in particular the investigation on the possible causes of the sea level rise from ice melting.
GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) is the first geodetic mission dedicated to the measurement of the time-variations of the Earth’s gravity field, it enables the detection of water mass transfers.
The on-going GRACE mission (launched in 03/2002 for a nominal lifetime of 5 years; quasi-polar orbit) provides monthly maps of tiny spatio-temporal variations of gravity due to the redistributions of mass inside the surface fluid envelops of the Earth. These satellite measurements represent vertically-integrated gravity effects of water mass reservoirs (oceans, atmosphere, continental waters and ice sheets) and of the solid Earth that need to be unravelled. Monthly solutions of the continental water storage (2002 to present) have been recently extracted from the raw GRACE geoids (at the resolution of 500 km), using an iterative generalized least-squares approach developed in our laboratory (LEGOS; Schmidt et al., 2005; Ramillien et al., 2005). After correction of important geophysical effects like mass changes induced by vertical s to study the ice sheets for the following objectives:

(1) Mass balance of the ice sheets: mapping for the first time the time variations of loss/gain of ice mass observed by GRACE, in response to climate change. This will provide monthly time series and geographical maps of the integrated variations of mass over large remote regions like Antarctica and Greenland.

(2) Contribution to the sea level rise: Estimating the mass balance of these polar regions, which can be further expressed in terms of sea level contribution. Recent results indicate that over the last 50 years and last 12 years, the contribution of thermal expansion of the oceans to sea level rise is 25% and 60% respectively (Cazenave and Nerem, 2004; Lombard et al., 2005a, b). For both time spans, the water mass addition to the oceans is estimated to about 1.4 mm/yr (Miller and Douglas, 2004; Lombard et al., 2005b). Recent direct estimates of mountain glaciers and ice sheets melting only explain 0.9 mm/yr (IPCC, 2005). In addition for the ice sheets (Antarctica and Greenland), these estimates based on airborne laser altimetry and other approaches are still uncertain (e.g., Thomas et al., 2004; Krabill et al., 2005). Measuring the mass balance of the ice sheets on inter-annual time scale using GRACE will represent a major improvement.

(3) Snow pack changes: Another objective of this project is to monitor the snow pack changes in the Arctic regions using GRACE. Changes of the snow pack are currently monitored from space using passive microwave radiometry. However, interpretation of these observations in term of snow mass change is very difficult because of problems related to surface conditions and snow state. Here again, GRACE can provide important constraints on snow mass change at a global scale. Snow mass solutions have been recently computed from the monthly GRACE geoids made available bythe GRACE project (GFZ and CSR) using a robust inverse method of separation of hydrological signals (Ramillien et al., 2004; Ramillien et al., 2005)

(4) Monitoring of the permafrost: GRACE is also able to provide information on melt of the permafrost in the boreal regions (e.g., Siberia) through associate water mass redistribution. Used in combination of water level (and discharge) measurements from satellite altimetry over Arctic rivers, GRACE data will allow us to detect and extract the permafrost signals.

The Andes Project ANDES project is developing advanced technology to
support distance education. Development of ANDES is funded by the
Annenberg Center for Communications at USC. The ANDES system allows
students to take courses at home, while accessing educational
resources on the Internet and engaging in teleconferences with
teachers and other students. The system will seamlessly integrate
net-based and CD-ROM-based educational resources. This project will
show that distance education can be delivered effectively in a
computer-based mode, in contrast to conventional techniques which rely
heavily on video broadcasts of lectures.

The goal of this work is to demonstrate the kinds of distance
education techniques that will be available once high-speed Internet
connections are commonplace. By storing resources on the student's
local machine, we can dramatically increase the perceived throughput
of the system. We intend to use this system as a vehicle for
collaborative education and pedagogical agent technologies.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Atlantic-THORPEX Observing System Test (Atlantic - TOST) is planned as a field campaign to make a significant contribution towards this common goal.  The primary aim of the Atlantic TOST is to test the real-time quasi operational targeting of observations using a number of platforms (including AMDAR, ASAP ships, extra radiosonde ascents, research aircraft and meteorological satellites).  To do this, it is necessary to identify suitable cases for targeting, provide information on the location of sensitive areas, and have the facilities to control each observing system at short notice.  The Atlantic TOST will be the first time that the real-time adaptive control of such a complex set of observing platforms has been attempted.  It is considered to be an essential preparation or proof of concept for future targeting field campaigns.  Additional scientific objectives of the Atlantic TOST will contribute to the understanding of the location and predictability of sensitive areas and the impact of targeted observations on forecast performance (and the benefit of potential new observing platforms).

   <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">AICI-IPY</skos:prefLabel>
   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Air-Ice Chemical Interactions – IPY coordinated studies</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The polar atmosphere is often considered both pristine and simple. However, there is a strong dynamic between the lower atmosphere and ice surfaces. Over the polar plateau, production in the snowpack controls the chemistry of the lower atmosphere. Halogen chemistry over the sea ice zone depletes boundary layer ozone, and causes mercury deposition. Persistent organic compounds undergo a distillation which leads to their deposition in polar regions. Biochemical processes in open leads play a major role in formation of cloud condensation (CCN) and ice forming nuclei (IFN), and through cloud formation this process may play a vital role in ice-albedo climate feedbacks.
The IGBP projects, IGAC and SOLAS, have jointly endorsed a task, “Air-Ice Chemical Interactions”, to determine the importance of these processes, and assess how they would alter with a warming climate and shrinking cryosphere. IPY offers a unique opportunity to determine the spatio-temporal pattern of chemistry and processes from the ice surface through the boundary layer, including cloud formation, by linking various field activities carried out in the same year. AICI-IPY will provide an overall framework, arrange supporting laboratory and modelling studies and integration of remote sensing data, and organise synthesis meetings. This work will support and link these more focussed field activities:
Polar plateau intensives: studying the influence of the snowpack, and boundary layer structure, by measuring concentrations, fluxes and processes at sites with different characteristics. Summit, Greenland has a long pedigree in air-snow studies, and this will be extended under AICI-IPY. The ANTCI group at South Pole expect to carry out further campaigns in IPY. AICI-IPY scientists will aim to add activities at Concordia (Antarctica).
The Arctic Summer Cloud-Ocean Study (ASCOS) will focus on the processes that control boundary layer clouds north of 80ºN, looking at CCN, IFN, and investigating marine biochemical and boundary layer meteorological processes that control their numbers. ASCOS expects to use the Swedish icebreaker, drifting from North Pole during summer 2007, and this will provide opportunities for synergy with other parts of AICI and related projects.
In the sea ice zone, both Arctic and Antarctic studies of gas phase chemistry are planned. The Arctic studies will mainly be hosted by the related project, OASIS (Ocean-Air-Sea Ice-Snow Interactions – EoI 344). OASIS contains ambitions both wider (biogeochemistry) and narrower (Arctic ocean/coast) than AICI, and will submit a separate detailed plan to IPY. POLARCAT (EoI 244) will provide some vertical context in the Arctic through aircraft campaign. Counterpart Antarctic coastal studies are already planned in Dronning Maud Land.
To provide an overall context for the intensive campaigns, AICI-IPY will determine the year-round spatial distribution of at least that most important molecule, ozone, in the boundary layer. No picture exists of the scale of ozone production and depletion, and its concentration in the boundary layer is not amenable to satellite observations. This work will link other AICI studies, using sensors deployed on autonomous platforms and buoys. AICI will coordinate individual polar operators to fill gaps on the map in the Antarctic and over Arctic land, while OASIS will cover parts of the Arctic Ocean.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Building on our previous work, we intend to test the hypothesis that the Larsen B Ice Shelf system has been a stable component of the cryosphere since it formed during rising sea levels 10,000 years ago. This conclusion would be an important step in establishing the uniqueness and consequences of the rapid warming taking place across the Peninsula. Our previous work on the Larsen A and B embayments taught us to recognize the signature and impact of past ice-shelf fluctuations. We have also overcome many of the limitations of radiocarbon-based chronologies in antarctic marine sequences by using geomagnetic-paleomagnetic intensity records for millennial-scale correlation and dating and by refining other dating techniques.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Short Title: RadTrace
Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=443

Radionuclides can serve as valuable tracers of atmospheric and terrestrial transport processes, which will be altered by changing climate patterns. This project is anchored in the existing Health Canada radiological monitoring network operated throughout Canada. The network includes seven Arctic sites equipped with high volume samplers for airborne particulates. Two of these sites are also equipped for noble gas collection and one site is equipped with a continuous gamma radiation monitor. In addition to the primary functions of supporting of the Canadian Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan and the international Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the network provides regular measurements of a wide range of naturally-occurring radionuclide concentrations in air. Heavy metals and some organic compounds will also be measured in airborne particulates collected by the air samplers. An archive of air filters extending back to the early 1970s will allow the elucidation of time trends in these contaminants. The Health Canada air monitoring network covers an area extending from 55o to 83o North Latitude and 60o to 135o West Longitude, representing a large fraction of the entire land mass in the North polar region. 

Data from the Canadian network will supplemented with similar data collected by collaborators in other countries notably Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. Ground-based sample collections will also be carried out in the Canadian north to gain a better understanding of the deposition of atmospheric contaminants and their movement through food chains leading to humans.

The objectives of this project are:
-Establish an international database for sharing data between monitoring networks in collaborating countries.
-Develop and extend atmospheric transport models to trace the movement of radionuclides and other contaminants from sources in temperate zones to remote Arctic locations
-Demonstrate changing trends in atmospheric circulation to the Arctic and within the Arctic by using these contaminants as tracers of atmospheric processes. 
-Document changes in soil gas emanation due to changing permafrost conditions.
-Examine the link between climate change and forest fires in the north
-Contribute to an understanding of ozone depletion in the stratosphere and ozone chemistry at ground level.
-Assess the impact of these changes on the movement of contaminants through Arctic ecosystems and particularly in food chains leading to humans.

The following ongoing and future studies will be carried out with the aid of air monitoring networks for radionuclides and other contaminants:
-A study carried out in collaboration with Meteorological Services of Canada has traced the movement of iodine-129 from nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in Siberia to remote locations in the Canadian Arctic. 
-Radioxenon from the reactor belt in eastern North America has been traced to Yellowknife, NWT. Measurements will be extended to include the long-lived krypton-85, a waste product from nuclear fuel reprocessing, in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions.
-Cesium-137 released from wood-burning in distant forest fires has been detected at the Yellowknife location. Levoglucosan, a combustion product from forest fires, will also be measured on archived air filters to provide an historical record of forest fire effects. 
-Measurements of uranium, radium, lead-210, and potassium-40, and total dust loading will give information on intercontinental dust transport.
-The short-lived radon and thoron decay products (lead-212, bismuth-214) are indicative of local emanations of soil gas and will be used to study changing permafrost conditions. 
-The beryllium isotopes (Be-7 and Be-10) are produced by cosmic irradiation of air molecules in the stratosphere. Their abundances and ratios at the earth's surface give information on exchanges of air masses between the stratosphere and troposphere, which are vulnerable to changing climate conditions.
-Measurements of heavy metals (e.g., Hg, Cd) and selected organic compounds will extend the range of sources and pathways that can be studied and will aid in the understanding of atmospheric chemistry processes in the Arctic. 

Details are still being worked out on the ground based studies. They will include collections of precipitation, soil, lichens, and higher plants to track the deposition of airborne contaminants and their movement through the food chain.

Proposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=20

The polar atmosphere is often considered both pristine and simple. However, there is a strong dynamic between the lower atmosphere and ice surfaces. Over the polar plateau, production in the snowpack controls the chemistry of the lower atmosphere. Halogen chemistry over the sea ice zone depletes boundary layer ozone, and causes mercury deposition. Persistent organic compounds undergo a distillation which leads to their deposition in polar regions. Biochemical processes in open leads play a major role in formation of cloud condensation (CCN) and ice forming nuclei (IFN), and through cloud formation this process may play a vital role in ice-albedo climate feedbacks.

The IGBP projects, IGAC and SOLAS, have jointly endorsed a task, Air-Ice Chemical Interactions, to determine the importance of these processes, and assess how they would alter with a warming climate and shrinking cryosphere. 

IPY offers a unique opportunity to determine the spatio-temporal pattern of chemistry and processes from the ice surface through the boundary layer, including cloud formation, by linking various field activities carried out in the same year. AICI-IPY will provide an overall framework, arrange supporting laboratory and modeling studies and integration of remote sensing data, and organise synthesis meetings. This work will support and link these more focused field activities:

Polar plateau intensives: studying the influence of the snowpack, and boundary layer structure, by measuring concentrations, fluxes and processes at sites with different characteristics. Summit, Greenland has a long pedigree in air-snow studies, and this will be extended under AICI-IPY. The ANTCI group at South Pole expect to carry out further campaigns in IPY. AICI-IPY scientists will aim to add activities at Concordia (Antarctica).  The Arctic Summer Cloud-Ocean Study (ASCOS) will focus on the processes that control boundary layer clouds north of 80ºN, looking at CCN, IFN, and investigating marine biochemical and boundary layer meteorological processes that control their numbers. ASCOS expects to use the Swedish icebreaker, drifting from North Pole during summer 2007, and this will provide opportunities for synergy with other parts of AICI and related projects.

In the sea ice zone, both Arctic and Antarctic studies of gas phase chemistry are planned. The Arctic studies will mainly be hosted by the related project, OASIS (Ocean-Air-Sea Ice-Snow Interactions  EoI 344). OASIS contains ambitions both wider (biogeochemistry) and narrower (Arctic ocean/coast) than AICI, and will submit a separate detailed plan to IPY. POLARCAT (EoI 244) will provide some vertical context in the Arctic through aircraft campaign. Counterpart Antarctic coastal studies are already planned in Dronning Maud Land.

To provide an overall context for the intensive campaigns, AICI-IPY will determine the year-round spatial distribution of at least that most important molecule, ozone, in the boundary layer. No picture exists of the scale of ozone production and depletion, and its concentration in the boundary layer is not amenable to satellite observations. This work will link other AICI studies, using sensors deployed on autonomous platforms and buoys. AICI will coordinate individual polar operators to fill gaps on the map in the Antarctic and over Arctic land, while OASIS will cover parts of the Arctic Ocean.

   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">

The Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation - Brazil was one of several planned
SCAR experiments conducted on August 13 - September 11, 1995 in
Central Brazil.  The objective of the SCAR-B project was to study the
radiative effects of burning biomass smoke and aerosols on clouds and
the climate.
The Smoke/Sulphate Clouds And Radiation (SCAR) experiments are a
series of field experiments whose main goal is to better understand
the impact of biomass burning and urban/industrial aerosol on the
atmosphere and therefore climate. During each SCAR experiment in situ
and remotely sensed data are measured simultaneously with the
objective to characterize most of the physical and chemical components
of the atmospheric aerosol, trace gases and clouds, the Earth's
surface, the radiation field and the properties of fires. The SCAR
series of experiments is designed to try to narrow some of the
uncertainties associated with the affect atmospheric aerosols have on
climate, either directly or indirectly, as well as to generate
information and prepare data for the evaluation of algorithms for
remote sensing from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) sensor on the Earth Observing System (EOS), planned for launch
in 1998. There are three planned SCAR experiments with the main
experiment to focus on the tropical biomass burning environment which
took place in Brazil during August/September 1995. The first two SCAR
experiments were conducted in the Eastern United States Atlantic
region (SCAR-A) in 1993 and in California and the Pacific Northwest
(SCAR-C) in 1994.  SCAR-A was designed to measure the properties of
urban and industrial pollution dominated by sulfate particles.  SCAR-C
measured the properties and radiative effects of smoke aerosol and
trace gases emitted from wild and prescribed fires in the Pacific
Northwest of the US. The SCAR series of experiments have been a
collaborative effort between United States and Brazilian scientists
and future collaborations between the two countries is expected to
continue for the long-term monitoring of trace gas and particle
emissions and their impact on the Earth's atmosphere and climate.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Antarctic Sea Ice in International Polar Year</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Sea ice thickness, combined with areal extent as the sea ice mass balance, is the principal response of climatic and oceanic interaction in the marine areas of Antarctica. A major thrust of the project is to obtain sea ice thickness, extent, and physical properties in order to characterize mechanisms of growth and decay and the roles of both the ocean and atmosphere in the sea ice annual cycle. Ice thickness data will be obtained by a variety of methods including visual and automatic camera ice observations from vessels, buoy arrays, airborne EM surveys, underice draft surveys using Autosub AUVs, satellite remote sensing and moored Upward Looking Sonar arrays. Establishment of a quantitative base for circumpolar ice thickness will allow for comparison to the ASPeCt ice thickness distribution derived from ship observations in the past and for future determinations of the thickness distribution that will be available from validated satellite altimetric observations. The Antarctic sea ice cover can then be quantitatively evaluated for response to global climate change in the future and these measurements, as the ice thickness baseline, will be a legacy of IPY. Comparisons of altimetric derived ice thicknesses with prior ship observations will provide ice thickness variability for a thirty year record in selected areas providing some possibility of interdecadal variability determination in sea ice thickness for the recent past as well. A new project from Finland, (S1FL), will contribute to the overall program by investigations of Sea Ice Mechanics and Modeling.
For the fast ice, a network of coastal stations, the Antarctic Fast Ice Network (277), is being established. As with the drifting pack, the response of the fast ice to changes in climate and oceanic influence will be monitored and understood with an array of stations to evaluate regional influences. Because of the access from the manned stations, a wider variety of through ice measurements and detailed structural analyses can be made on a year-round basis than for the drifting pack giving more detailed information. A variety of remote sensing data will also be used to map and characterize fast ice and ground stations will be used to provide validation for remote sensing.
Remote sensing is a direct component of the lead project (270), to validate satellite altimetric measurements of Antarctic sea ice thickness. Two other projects are primarily remote sensing projects: Multi-frequency, multi-polarization helicopter-borne scatterometer measurements of sea ice radar backscatter".(308), and a new project from Malaysia, (S2Malay), Polar Ice Monitoring and Parameter Retrieval with Microwave Remote Sensing. One focus of the first project will be on the investigation of the multi-frequency backscattering properties of thin ice, including an attempt to derive its thickness from these measurements and to map frost flowers. S2Malay will perform theoretical modelling and conduct its ground truth measurements on thick fast ice in association with the Antarctic Fast Ice Network(277).
In collaboration with the field work, modelling and remote sensing associated with ice thickness and physical properties measurements (9 eoi’s), three projects coordinated by BASICS(862) will conduct year-round studies of Antarctic sea ice physics, biogeochemistry and biology on drifting pack ice and fast ice to better understand and budget exchanges of energy and matter across ocean-sea ice-atmosphere interfaces. BASICS will quantify their potential impact on fluxes of climatically important gases (CO2, DMS) and carbon export to the deep ocean; the Study of Antarctic Sea Ice Ecosystems(818) will focus on the biology within sea ice and relationship to ice physical properties; while Carbon in Sea Ice (976) will provide coordination between the Antarctic and Arctic efforts to understand how sea ice biogeochemistry controls CO2 fluxes.

The Instituto Antártico Argentino was created under the Decree Nº 7338 on April the 17th 1951. Its founder and first director was the colonel Hernán Pujato. The goal of this creation was the need of a specialized organism to orientate, control, address and perform scientific and technical research and studies concerning this region, in coordination with the Comisión Nacional del Antártico, an institution depending on the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Stations set up at Marguerite Bay, Hope Bay, and Filchner Ice Shelf, and scientific summer seasons were the support for these goals, including a wide range of earth, sea and air sciences.

completed the first phase of a project to calibrate SEBAL, the
Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land. While SEBAL has been
used in Asia, Africa, and Europe, this project represents the
first application in North America.

This is one of nine 'Infomart' projects across the United States
awarded as part of a NASA and Raytheon Company program called
the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)
Synergy Program. This work is supported by funding from The
Idaho Department of Water Resources, the University of Idaho's

Phase I of the project was completed at the end of 2000, and
Phase II ended at the end of 2001. IDWR and UI are presently
working on Phase III, which is structured as an operational test
of SEBAL as a tool for water right management on the Eastern
Snake River Plain.

Program Code: SURE
Program Title: Sulfate Regional Experiment
The Sulfate Regional Experiment (SURE) was designed to investigate the
behavior of airborne sulfur oxides and associated substances over the
greater northeastern United States.  The study area extended from
eastern Kansas to theAtlantic seaboard and from mid-Alabama to
southeastern Canada, an area of approximately 2,400 by 1,000 km.  The
study was motivated by concerns in the early 1970s that suspended
sulfates impair human health when inhaled in a mixture of pollutant
gases and other suspended particulate components.  Since then it has
been established that adverse health effects are not associated with
ambient sulfate concentrations as formerly thought.  However, sulfur
oxides and their copollutants, nitrogen oxides, may have roles in
governing the acidity of the atmosphere and precipitation, and in
impairing visibility, but these aspects of air quality were not
studied explicitly in the SURE project.
The primary objectives of the SURE project were:
1) Establish a regional air quality data base through measurements of
several parameters at the ground and aloft with specified accuracy and
precision, and evaluate the adequacy of the measurements selected for
establishing the origins of the sulfur oxide particulate complex.
2) Establish the location and magnitude of emissions occurring during
the air quality measurement period with specified accuracy and
precision.  In addition to sulfur oxides the emissions inventory
included the nitrogen oxides, gaseous hydrocarbons and particles.
3) Derive a quantitative method for relating emissions from the
electric power industry to regional ambient air quality as measured by
sulfur dioxide and particulate sulfate.  Using this method establishes
the relative importance of emission density distribution, meteorology,
chemical transformations, and removal processes to the regional
occurrence of sulfur and nitrogen oxides.
Continuous air quality measurements were obtained at 9 Class I
stations from August 1977 through June 1979.  Intermittent air quality
measurements were obtained during seasonally representative sampling
months at 45 Class II stations and from aircraft from August 1977
through December 1978.  These seasonally intensive sampling months
were August 1977, October 1977, January-February 1978, April 1978,
July 1978, and October 1978.

   <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">Antarctic Peninsula Magnetotelluric Transects</skos:altLabel>
   <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Ten tensor magnetotelluric (MT) soundings have been acquired in a 54 km long profile across the South Pole area, East Antarctica. The MT transect was offset from the South Pole station ∼5 km and oriented 210 grid north, approximately normal to the Trans-Antarctic Mountains. Surveying around South Pole station was pursued for four main reasons. First, we sought to illuminate first-order structure and physico-chemical state (temperatures, fluids, melts) of the crust and upper mantle of this part of East Antarctica. Secondly, conditions around the South Pole differ from those of previous MT experience at central West Antarctica, so that the project would help to define MT surveying feasibility over the entire continent. Thirdly, the results would provide a crustal response baseline for possible long-term MT monitoring to deep upper mantle depths at the South Pole. Fourthly, because Antarctic logistics are difficult, support facilities at the South Pole enable relatively efficient survey procedures. In making the MT measurements, the high electrical contact impedance at the electrode-firn interface was overcome using a custom-design electrode pre-amplifier at the electrode with low output impedance to the remainder of the recording electronics. Non-plane-wave effects in the data were suppressed using a robust jackknife procedure that emphasized outlier removal from the vertical magnetic field records. Good quality data were obtained, but the rate of collection was hampered by low geomagnetic activity and wind-generated, electrostatic noise induced in the ice. Profile data were inverted using a 2-D algorithm that damps model departures from an a priori structure, in this case a smooth 1-D profile obtained from inversion of an integral of the TM mode impedance along the profile. Inverse models show clear evidence for a pronounced (∼1 km thickness), conductive section below the ice tentatively correlated with porous sediments of the Beacon Supergroup. Substantial variations in sedimentary conductance are inferred, which may translate into commensurate variations in sediment thickness. Low resistivities below ∼30 km suggest thermal activity in the lower crust and upper mantle, and mantle support for this region of elevated East Antarctica. This contrasts with resistivity structure imaged previously in central West Antarctica, where resistivity remains high into the upper mantle consistent with a fossil state of extensional activity there.

The fundamental objectives of United States Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics
(U.S. GLOBEC) Program are dependent upon the cooperation of scientists from
several disciplines. Physicists, biologists, and chemists must make use of data
collected during U.S. GLOBEC field programs to further our understanding of the
interplay of physics, biology, and chemistry. Our objectives require
quantitative analysis of interdisciplinary data sets and, therefore, data must
be exchanged between researchers. To extract the full scientific value, data
must be made available to the scientific community on a timely basis.

The Southern Ocean exerts a strong influence on global climate through
the circulation of the Circumpolar Current and the seasonal shift of
the sea-ice cover. While currently there are many different ways of
assessing the intensity of phenomena associated with Climatic Change
(ozone depletion, increase of temperature, CO2 and UV radiation),
there is no single tool for measuring the indirect effects of these
alterations, most of which are critical to the functioning of
ecosystems. In the marine environment, changes in thermal gradients
modify the global oceanic circulation pattern, thus bringing
unpredictable consequences to the structure of communities, trophic
relationships and biogeochemical cycling. The geographic distribution
and abundance of plankton stem from a combination of factors that
include the interaction between the life cycle of species, oceanic
circulation, formation of eddies, the behaviour of frontal systems
(e.g., advance and retreat of the sea-ice cover), and the abundance of
vertebrate predators (fish, birds and marine mammals). Any alteration,
natural and/or anthropogenic (e.g., fisheries), in the intensity of
predation leads to a change in the structure of trophic webs, thus
affecting biodiversity, concentration of key Antarctic species,
nutrient loading and carbon fluxes to the deep-sea, often resulting in
the general unbalance of the ecosystem. In order to examine within an
integral framework this conjunction of factors, the present project
will focus on the seasonality of one of the most peculiar areas of the
Southern Ocean: the Drake Passage, a key open-ocean choke point for
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The pronounced continental
constriction between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula causes
the northern deflection of the ACC and, jointly with the ENSO cycles,
influences directly the Southwestern Atlantic in terms of
oceanographic-atmospheric and biological processes. Drake Bioseas is
intended to achieve a first step towards the understanding of these
processes by covering aspects that range from the assessment of
air-sea interactions to geochronological surveys of the sea bottom,
and from organisms living in the pelagic realm to benthic communities
and micro-paleonthological indicators, emphasising in the
Magellan-Antarctic regions and the Atlantic-Pacific
connections. Specific richness, population density, biomass and
geographic distribution, shifts in community structure and
biogeography, oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant defenses
will be examined for bacteria, protozoa, planktonic algae, meso-and
macrozooplankton, sea birds and marine mammals. Antarctic and
subantarctic fishes will be examined only as to their systematic
(morphological and molecular) and oxidative stress; this will allow
elucidating the patterns of distribution of key species, migration
processes and physiological responses to environmental
changes. Special attention will be paid to dormant stages of
microscopic organisms (non active bacteria, auxospore formation,
cysts, resting propagules) as well as to factors controlling the
timing of activation. The role of species within the trophic web will
be evaluated, taking into consideration a wide spectrum of topics,
including fluctuations in the nutritional mode of unicellular
organisms, diet composition, energy content, interspecific food
overlapping in top predators, etc. Previous information from land,
coastal and open ocean communities, provided from scientists involved
in the project and by official and private institutions dedicated to
fisheries, will constitute the tools for comparisons of past and
current conditions. Such objectives make Drake Bioseas directly link
to CCAMLR, EBA SCAR and CAML projects. This will be the first time in
which a multidisciplinary and integrated approach is made on waters of
the Drake Passage and its surroundings, emphasizing on the seasonal
and inter-annual dynamics (2007-2008) of marine communities in natural
boundaries such as Subantarctic vs. Antarctic, neritic vs. oceanic,
Pacific vs. Atlantic, summer vs. winter, low- vs. mid-latitude
environments, and on trophic relationships (areas/seasons/years of
dominance of net phytoplanktonic cells vs. DOM-based microbial food
web, and of crustacean vs. gelatinous zooplankton) and the magnitude
of ecosystem fluctuations due to frontal behaviour (Subantarctic
Front, Polar Front, Ice-Edge, winter conjunction of Polar and Ice
fronts). Manipulative experimental work (productivity, grazing,
physiological responses) on board will be carried out to complement in
situ studies. Besides its scientific goals, the priorities of this
endeavour embrace the legacy of an Experimental Research Centre for
multidisciplinary studies on cold-water organisms, and an Argentine
icebreaker reconditioned for scientific purposes. These legacies are
expected to significantly contribute to the formation of a new
generation of "bio-seas" scientists.
